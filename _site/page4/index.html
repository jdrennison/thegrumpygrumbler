  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Let's talk about being a man. A real man, that is. Let's bring up those things that separate the real men from the effeminate ones, the boys and the metrosexuals. Let's praise real men as these are depicted in a Boris Vallejo fantasy painting.</p>
<p>A real man never finishes all of the milk from a bottle in the fridge. He will always leave a tiny bit in the end for use in his morning coffee or tea. The real man will only be using a fraction of the available quantity each time he needs milk for his beverages now matter how little that is and therefore the amount of the milk left will asymptotically be reaching its depletion. Only the use-by date can act as a cut-off date.</p>
<p>A real man never drinks shandy. Seriously, have you seen anyone walk into a bar in a fresh haircut and a nice suit, walk up to the bartender fixing his sleeves and say "hit me with your best Forster's shandy"? If you want to drink shandy ask your girlfriend or one of the females in your group to order it when it's her round. Right? Wrong! It was a trick question. Now get out of my face!</p>
<p>A real man has done a shampoo mohawk in the shower.</p>
<p>A real man doesn't like the word "male". Ladies, use synonyms.</p>
<p>A real man won't look away if a scantily clad woman notices him checking her out. She's having her assets on display. What has the real man got to be embarrassed about? If you're dressed like a slapper you'll be treated like one. You know motherfucking well what I'm talking about. If yoh wear a wide belt you think is a skirt and show cleavage don't then wonder why you can't find a man who likes you for who you are.</p>
<p>A real man always takes a long, hard look at the product of his last bowel movement and exhale in admiration before he reaches for the flush button. It looks like last night's pizza didn't go to waste after all.</p>
<p>A real man only knows the following colours: red, white, blue, green, yellow, brown, black. Ecru, lilac, fuchsia, turquoise and other shit like that simply do not compute.</p>
<p>A real man never takes "selfies". Seriously, that vain fucking shite needs to cunting stop. It was better when they did it when selfies were not yet called selfies but now it's like they're coming out of a fucking cloning tank. They think that men want to be them and women want to be with them. What we really think is "what an attention fuckin' whore".</p>
<p>A real man has attempted to sneak a fart by on a first date. Not always successfully but attempted it he has.</p>
<p>A real man drives manual. I don't want to hear about it. When it comes to driving, it's manual or nothing. At least in the UK the majority of cars are manual so at least there's that. Also, a real man will slip it from three to two just to get off by listening the engine roar.</p>
<p>A real man will sometimes slam an electronic device when it stops working. It doesn't matter if your smartphone is a sensitive electronic device with thousands of ultra-large scale integrated circuits and no moving parts. Just slam it on the side. What have you got to lose? I won't forget how that worked in the case of my tablet. I dropped it on the ground from lower back label and when I turned it on the screen showed gibberish. It would then continue showing gibberish no matter how many times I turned it off and back on. Then I said "fuck it" and let it drop on the floor again. That fixed it. Maybe this snapped a capacitor back into one of the soldered holes it broke off from or something. In any case. If you're a real man you've smacked things that stopped working, from a PC to a smartphone and, if you're my age or older, a CRT monitor or two. These actually did work again when you smacked them.</p>
<p><strong>Are you a real man, were you a real man in the past, or do you know someone affected by being a real man? We'd like to hear your story. Are there any other things that inevitably define real men and you believe are left out? Feel free to add those in the comments section.</strong></p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Every couple of years tabloids in the UK protest vehemently about halal meat being in grocery stores' shelves without the consumer knowing about it. The last incarnation of this happened a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>The idea behind selling only halal meat is saving money as both Muslims and non-Muslims can eat halal. I suppose Jews too can eat halal. Which is probably why we've never heard any professional worry-inducers informing us about kosher meat being sold without us knowing about it.</p>
<p>I'd like to know if my meat is halal or kosher just out of curiosity. But what's the fuss about? It's still the same meat and the only difference is how the animal it comes from is killed. Sure there's some worry about animal cruelty because in halal and kosher butchering the animal dies slowly. Well, shit. Look how this cow is peacefully eating grass without a care in the world. Little does she know that parts of her will be on my plate soon with plenty of gravy and a Yorkshire pudding. Just make sure she's got a swift and painless death 'fore I gobble up her arsecheeks because what's more important than proteins and vitamins I need is that my eventual dinner isn't in pain when its life is extracted.</p>
<p>Our concern for cattle will never extend to not eating them so does it matter how they expire? This "humane killing" of animals thing, has only become a thing in the recent years possibly because it sounded like an oxymoron in previous generations. Suppose you witness a cow having her throat slit open and her blood flowing slowly out of the incision. She jerks around at first until numbness sets in as the last thought that crosses her mind is the grassy plains she used to feast on under an overcast sky and she's never going to see again. You'll at first feel sorry for the life lost. Then you might liken our species to the lion who jumps on its unsuspecting prey, wrestles it to the floor and savages it. Then you will shrug and think, oh well, it is what it is and this is a world where the big fish eats the smaller one. And then you're gonna go home but not before you drop by Tesco's to buy a beef fillet for lunch thinking that perhaps it would have been better to snatch half a thigh from the recently slashed animal as can trust that it won't have an horse traces in it. Unless they make cows eat horses in the animal farm you had been. So no. Deep down you couldn't give a fucking shit how cattle is killed but you just pretend to sound vaguely reasonable.</p>
<p>One could argue about the practice of religiously slaughtered meat but I don't want to get political here in this site in case I "come under fire" for speaking about a "controversial" topic and end up as news in some rag, being made to look like a fucking knobhead. This is what freedom of speech has come to.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I'd include clichés like the Harbour and the Peak in this post but I'd rather eat my own spleen.</p>
<h2>Mass Transit Railway</h2>
<p>In Admiralty there is a sign that says "MTR keeps you on schedule". In the two weeks I spent there the Hong Kong Metro trains were frequent and would never break down. The metro would just work. I can rely on it to take me to the airport without having to leave five hours before my flight "to allow for extra time". Imagine a big sign at Oxford Circus station: "The Tube keeps you on schedule". The Daily Mail would be all over it hours later with an article titled "Tube bosses think the Tube runs on time and doesn't have signal failures or train breakdowns or people ending their lives on the tracks or weekend closures".</p>
<p>Ok, the title needs a bit more work.</p>
<h2>Surgical masks</h2>
<p>In the last 11 years Hong Kong had had two major viral outbr... errr hang on, hang on. In what way were the SARS and the bird flu major outbreaks? Because if you remember rightly, serious-looking people in suits would parade on the telly to tell us that we were all going to die. But we didn't.</p>
<p>When I hear about a "major outbreak" or a "pandemic", I expect it to be followed up by reports of villages whose whole population has been eradicated overnight. I expect to hear about medical camps hosting thousands of virus-stricken victims in their death throes. When the SARS and the HxNx viruses were in their heydays did all Hong Kong ports close? Were the bridges to Shenzhen closed off or bombed and everyone trying to cross over shot on sight?</p>
<p><a href="https://thegrumbler.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/640px-rz_walker_2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-502" src="assets/640px-rz_walker_2.png" alt="Infected outbreak" width="500" height="209" /></a></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;">And if the virus took away the higher functions of the human brain and made the victim withstand extreme pain would they incinerate the populated areas with thermite plasma?</p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;">-Photo: <span style="color:#d5d4d4;">Added by </span><a style="color:#c61010;" href="http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/User:Vatsa1708" target="_blank">Vatsa1708</a></p>
<p>And yet there have been government warnings after government warnings and now you see every other person there wear a surgical mask. I'm no expert but I think a surgical mask won't protect you fully as an airborne disease can still enter from the sides but it can reduce the risk of infection. Also you protect others if you're infected. By looking at a train carriage in London every morning I can pick at least ten people who could use a mask. We're no different than Hong Kong in that we can also contract airborne diseases. Always think of surgical masks next time some inconsiderate motherfucking idiot sneezes on you and offers a grovelling apology. What is your "sorry" good for, cunt? Now get the fuck out of my fucking face.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>Dai Pai Dong must be considered the worst of the worst eateries if the government is trying to close them down. Yet the few times I've been to one, the food seemed as fresh as anywhere else. And it's also a good selling point to tourists. In fact, I liked the food everywhere I've eaten there. When i first moved to the UK it took me nearly a year to get used to the food here. Also, the best takeaway in the UK is worse than the worst takeaway in Hong Kong. Have you tried the kebab in London? Imagine the pus from a skin abscess mixed with flu phlegm and snot. Well, the kebab in the UK is a bit worse than that. I'm not blaming the owners of the UK takeaways, they're just doing what they can with the raw materials they can get. Maybe that's why I've not heard anyone from the government say that they want to shut these shops down.</p>
<h2>Living it up</h2>
<p>I know it's partly due to that there's not enough space for so many people. But these people know how to party. I've seen eateries serving food at 1 am. I don't think they just stay open to serve all those who couldn't be seated when said eateries were full at 8 pm. Food is part of the culture. Alcohol, they do not abuse. You won't see the police picking up drunken slobs from the street who've just glassed someone in the face. People just live their lives consuming things and eating a lot of fresh seafood.</p>
<p>And the safety. I saw once a young girl in a dark street in Mong Kok typing things away on her laptop.</p>

    <h2>Soho and Lan Kwai Fong</h2>
<p>What can one say about these two places. They're magnificent albeit overpriced. I don't say very often that something is "magnificent", I usually do it when I'm on holiday somewhere different and in a good mood.</p>
<p>First of all, you can tell that the quality of the westerners here is so much better than in the West. It makes sense, I guess. If you're prepared to sit in a metal bird for 13 hours to go to an exotic place you're probably learned some hard lessons in life or you've grown up in a sheltered middle-class family with money and you've had a gap year at the back of beyond already and generally have a certain financial reserve to travel the world or be sent abroad on a contract by a big corporation that has hired you over your exemplary communication and problem solving skills. Or some shit. I don't know, it doesn't make sense really. I had heard these are gathering points for westerners and what immediately came to mind was drunkedness, vomiting and glassings. And a strong police presence. Alas, even the drunks could behave themselves there. What has this world come into?</p>
<p>Some bars had "get pissed for less" offers. Also, a bloke would walk around with a tray of syringes with shots in them. I've not seen this in the UK because I suppose there is a law against it. I've never understood this. If there are so many alcohol restrictions in place why not just go all the way and ban it altogether? Or would that be fascist? I understand the bottle is a method of escape for many but they're ruining it for the rest of us who only want to drink a couple of beers and stop there.</p>
<h2>Wan Chai</h2>
<p>Basically, the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">red light district</span> fuck-joints of Hong Kong are congregated here. I knew this before I went there because someone had told me so. There are bars too but many of them act as venues for meetings of a different nature. That I found out by myself. I was minding my own business trying to order a drink from the bar when I felt at least two pairs of Filipino eyes on me. "'Fuck they want" I thought to myself while I was excusing myself towards the beer taps. One of them locks eyes on mine and I smile. She is quite pretty, I wonder if... no, fuck that. This looks too easy, what the fuck is happening here? I grab my drink and turn around to leave then I feel a hand stroking my back. "Hey babe" says the scantily clad woman smiling.</p>
<p>Seriously. I'm all for meeting someone when I'm on holiday but (a) I'm a bit less grumpy when in a holiday mood therefore it would be unfair for her when we're back home and (b) these women are either whores or house cleaners and tourists should watch their backs.</p>
<p>If she's a whore it's quite likely it'll cost you more than you expect. The bar takes commission to allow her to work there. If she doesn't "close", you have wasted her time and yours. In adjacent bars where all the girls are on the clock, one of them comes to chat to you shortly after you walk in and you haven't picked somebody already. If you turn to leave without buying her drinks usually a big guy will block your way out and demand money as the girl has provided you with the service of being a confidante for ten of her minutes. To the people who run these places the business model is quite simple: once you've walked in you're going to part with some of your money whether be it a big or a small chunk in your wallet. I find it rather degrading to pay a girl just to have her talk to me so I've never visited one of those establishments.</p>
<p>If she's a house cleaner she thinks all us whitefolk are loaded. I'm pretty convinced the logic is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tourist has saved up enough to be here and go on a spending spree right now.</li>
<li>The expat was probably sent here on a contract and therefore gets paid the big bucks.</li>
<li>I am working 6 days a week for peanuts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do understand it's not easy for them, breaking their backs 12 hours six days a week and feeding their families back home. Whatever blows their skirts up. I sat on that street drinking for about an hour and a half and the middle-aged white men getting out of that bar with Asian women whom they then put in cabs and then got on them themselves hadn't stopped.</p>
<p>Now, the men who frequent these places. Typically middle aged, many of them fat, a few not fat. Many of them balding, a few, not balding. In fact, I don't understand where the stereotype of the fat, balding middle-aged man who hunts Asian women comes from. Many of those I saw were neither fat not balding. There were all middle aged though. The man of our story is typically in Hong Kong on a 12-month corporate contract with a family back home and could be either of the two types below:</p>
<p><strong>The pissed-off family man.</strong></p>
<p>His wife is bored stiff of him, his teen children hate him. The year in Hong Kong will be an means of escape and to his wife his actions in the SAR are to be treated like a black box. I'm here to put some money on the table and also do you remember that house extension we never had money for? Now we'll be able to have it built. Just don't ask what I'm doing in my free time.</p>
<p><strong>The cheater-by-circumstance</strong></p>
<p>It was a bit harder for him to part with the missus and the kids but it's for the best. Maybe the family can visit in autumn when the weather is not too hot. He wants to discover what Hong Kong has to offer but never thought to do someone other than his wife. Then one evening, an expat coworker or an already existing cheater-by-circumstance he met in Lan Kwai Fong two nights before says to him "want to hit Wan Chai tomorrow? We can get some Asian 'strange' there, man!" He may be madly in love with his wife but he won't see her for a few more months. It only goes to show some things about us. Our girlfriend could be fit as fuck and love us madly but we're just never satisfied and always looking for another hole to shove it through no matter if it's better or worse. Take Hugh Grant for example.</p>
<p>This is what you would expect in Pattaya but surely not in Hong Kong?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong is an amazing place. I spent two weeks there recently and I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>Well, I said it. You thought I was going to whine like a little bitch right from the get-go didn't you? Oh, well here it comes.</p>
<p>"Most people like to spend only a few days there. What did you do in two weeks? Did you not get bored?", I hear you ask. Although I don't have to, let me explain.</p>
<p>First off, I've done the "few days in Hong Kong" type of thing and it left me with a bitter taste in the mouth. I felt I was doing Hong Kong a disservice by just half-arsing it through the most popular tourist attractions in two days and then fucking off. Never again, I said as soon as I took off from Chek Lap Kok. Hong Kong, we will meet again soon.</p>
<p>Second, I did want to go to the mainland very much but you really have to take three weeks off work to really enjoy it. I could have done 4 days in Beijing, 4 days in Shanghai, 4 days in Hong Kong but I'd be pressed for time and I'd love to spend more days to enjoy each.</p>
<p>Third, I'm not "most people", it's my fucking trip and I can do whatever the fuck I want with it.</p>
<p>They say jet lag is worse when you travel eastbound but this theory doesn't hold water. The jet lag is always worse when you return home from your holiday, always. Also, the flight is always longer. So the perceived time that passes when flying back to the UK always seem longer than the perceived time that passes when flying to Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>After a day of orientation where I did absolutely nothing (they say a task length expands to fill in the available time you have to do it) I went to a well-known dim sum restaurant in Kowloon. This is the conversation that transpired between me and the waitress:</p>
<p>-Excuse me, did you just order chicken feet?<br />
-Yeah. You haven't just run out of it have you?<br />
-Are you sure you want chicken feet? Do you know what it is?<br />
-Yes I know what chicken feet is.</p>
<p>So off she takes and a few seconds later she comes back with a bowl with a couple of chicken paws in it as a last chance to back down before I get it on my table, I guess. I simply nodded and insisted to get it.</p>
<p>I thought that to them, "The West" is a big obscure weird place where everyone loathes the idea of eating any animal parts that aren't from the shoulders or the thighs or the back or the chest of said animal.</p>
<blockquote><p>Son, make sure you do your vaccinations when you visit Europe. I've heard those people like to eat pork ribs and spaghetti.</p>
<p>-Chinese dad to his son</p></blockquote>
<p>In some restaurants in Chinatown in London they mark certain dishes in the menu as "not recommended for European taste" and those are the dishes that attract my interest the most. What do you mean "not recommended"? Perhaps they should change the notice to something like "not recommended for British taste". Because if I told the cooks in any of the restaurants there what we sometimes eat in the Old Country, they'd rip up their cooking certificates and get on the first boat back to China. I brought up some examples to a Hong Kong Chinese. Her reaction: ewwwhowcanyoueatthisthisissodisgustingohmygod.</p>
<blockquote><p>After this I can safely claim that the mysteries of the Orient are no mystery to me. Will you let me have you now, cute Hong Kong girl?</p>
<p>-Agent Johnny English to cute Hong Kong girl</p></blockquote>
<h2>Tailor Touts</h2>
<p>This applies in every place there are touts.<br />
If you've been to Tsim Sha Tsui and you look whi... sorry, I mean Western, you know what I'm taking about. Picture yourself in front of the mirror thinking this:</p>
<p>- Hell yeah. Nice suit I got after all. I only stopped by Hong Kong for a couple of nights on my way to Auckland and I already own 20 suits but there was this kind Indian gentleman who kept following me around the block saying things like "Hey, where do you think you're going? Look at me when I'm talking to you! Just stop for a minute to have a look at my catalogue!". That's what persuaded me to buy this £300 suit.</p>
<p>You may have been in this position once or know someone who has?</p>
<p>What do you mean you don't? I don't know, it might have something to do with that it hasn't happened to anyone in the history of man.</p>
<p>No one likes touts. Fucking no one.</p>
<p>I know and respect the fact that these people are only trying to put food on the table but this business model is worth observing. This is the 2010s. There are businesspeople around the world who think that having someone troll tourist spots and grab unsuspecting tourists by the bollocks and drag them into a dungeon with merchandise is just as effective as dishing out flyers (they already print out price lists on thick paper) or listing their businesses on Trip Advisor or doing viral marketing. Or do some shit other than employing touts. Touts should at last get through their thick skulls that if someone is ignoring them or mumbling "no thanks" while not looking at them doesn't mean "I'm ambivalent about buying one of your beautiful, high-quality thread suits but run behind me and say to me 'Hold on just for a second, just to take a look at the suits we can make for you' one more time and I'll be sure to stop and pay you cash in hand for the suit, a pair of shiny leather shoes and a cotton shirt without even asking for a guarantee that the goods will ship to my address because I'm the trusting guy".</p>
<p>There is a female and less-aggresive version of touts in Soho and Lan Kwai Fong. I don't know if there's a similar English saying but in the Old Country we have a saying: "a cunt hair can pull a cargo ship". I want to believe that the post-modern sophisticated expat men who have travelled half the globe to be there do not subscribe to this saying and won't fall for a short skirt standing outside a bar trying to lure men in. For the most part I am right. However, I did not include the Wan Chai district. More on this in Part 2.</p>
<h2>Lantau Island day tour</h2>
<p>I can't quite remember the tour guide's name but she said to just remember it rhymes with 'queen'. "They call me 'The Queen' in these parts", she went on to say in her fake American accent. "In fact I've been likened to Queen Latifah". Well, she wasn't <strong>entirely </strong>talking out of her arsehole. If Queen Latifah had an illegitimate child with Mr. Chow from Hangover this is what it'd look like. Later on when she said there is no such thing as Lantau Peak and there's only one Peak and that is in Hong Kong island, I decided not to correct her in front of the group mostly because I was going to look more of a twat than she would.</p>
<p>Tai O. A picturesque fishing village almost entirely built on stilts. The fishermen there are probably tired of gweilo faces walking around the place but I think a large part of the local revenue is generated by tourism so they generally shut up about it and take our money.</p>
<p>There, just as in the rest of Hong Kong, they sell dried seafood. The tour guide expressed her, let's call it, indignation that some tourists are surprised that Hong Kongers eat smelly food. "Well why do you eat blue cheese", she said. "This may be as strange to us as us eating smelly food is strange to you". Someone had to explain to her that the West is a big place and in lots of parts of it we find blue cheese disgusting. Hell, I don't even know what blue cheese is. It sounds like one of those cheeses that come with a fungus in them and you're supposed to just eat it along with the cheese. She should be aware of all that already before she addresses all of the group as "you". I was going to explain this to her in front of the group but, you guessed it, it was going to make me look more of a twat than her. Alternatively I would chat to her during the "free time" segments of the tour had she not decided to disappear or just ignore us for a fag. Yes, her job is probably boring but she'll probably have to do something else soon. The numbers of tourists that go to these tours are dwindling. These days we have smartphones with applications and we can learn everything we want from travel websites. In the group I was in, there were no more than six people including me. I'm sure that just like me they booked the tour just to get an easy way to cruise around Lantau's hot spots and see as many attractions as possible without waiting and changing many buses, not because this is the best or only way to go to Lantau.</p>
<p>Ngong Ping village. That's not immediately obvious from the tourist brochures but despite its "traditional"-sounding name this is an artificial village with no permanent residents. The "village" is part of the Ngong Ping 360 tourist site which has souvenir shops, restaurants, ice cream kiosks and a Starbucks. The giveaway was the Starbucks. Non-artificial Hong Hong villages don't have Starbucks.</p>
<p>By the way, do you know that smell that comes from the rubbish bins on a street from which a seafood street market has just closed business and left for the day? That's what dried seafood in Hong Kong smells like.</p>
