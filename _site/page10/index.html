    <p>Iceland. It's far away, it's small we don't hear about it often. In my mind, it was a place to which I hadn't given much thought but I had it at the back of my mind as a weekend destination. In short, it was up there and we left it alone and it did likewise.</p>
<p>That was before the volcano. I suppose you can see where I'm going with this. I thought volcanoes existed only in fiction. I had seen one or two in the Smurfs back in the 80s, I've also seen "Volcano" and "Dante's Peak". And I thought that was the end of it. Alright, volcanoes exist but it's not every time one erupts that wrecks a continent's airspace.</p>
<p>I haven't written anything here for a month and it would probably be two months if volcanoes didn't just decide to blow up just three days before my holiday abroad.</p>
<p>Fucking volcano, man. Can you fucking believe it.</p>

    <p>After waiting 10 minutes for the ceiling mounted train table to display a platform number for my train, it finally does and I hear a few exhalation sounds from all around me just three nanoseconds before the stationary crowd becomes a moving mass directed to the platforms.</p>
<p>Yes, face it. All these people will travel on the same train as you. For only one moment you are under the illusion that most of them will be lazy fucks and won't walk all the way to the front coach where you will casually stride in, find three seats in a row waiting for you, but then you realise that you won't be traveling with lazy chavs from Charing Cross Station, but with professionals who also worked overtime like you, and they are willing to walk to the front coach.</p>
<p>As you touch  your Oyster card on the sensor, your todger goes into the behind of the woman in your front for whom the turnstile didn't open. Now I know we all tend to blame a scratched oyster card or a defec tive oyster sensor. But, really, all it takes is to firmly place your oystercard on the reader and WAIT until the doors open.<br />
Whe the train stops at your station, there are two women standing at the door in front of you and they look at each other in puzzlement one of them repeatedly presses the door button and the doors don't budge, until I point out to her that she is pressing the "close" button. Now, I don't know if women really can't read maps as per popular reputation, but I'm more inclined to take that reputation at face value after this.</p>
<p>The bus, however, is a wholly different story. There is no turnstile and if the Oyster of the poor sod in front of you doesn't check out, there's usually a good reason. You can then sneak yours by while they're pontificating whether they should pay by cash or go to the nearest convenience store and top it up. I mean, the bus will be held up for about 10 seconds but at least you will have moved well down and found yourself a nice seat, preferably without chav-marks on it. What those chav-marks may be, I will leave to your imagination.</p>
<p>Just as your bus goes through a stop or two, you hear a recorded female voice saying "This bus is on diversion." Before she can continue with "Please listen to further announcements" most people have got off their seats with discontent clearly seen on their faces. A similar scene in an Athens bus would also be accompanied by  a good proper rant by some male passengers ("fucking whore, wait till I get my hands on you") but none of that happens here. Instead, as I get off my seat I wonder what the TfL's journey planner's good for as very few people seem to use it. Then it comes down to me: I'm not the only lazy fuck on the bus.</p>
<p>I know I've pushed the envelope writing too much about public transport at the expense of other aspects of life but I'll make up for it.</p>

    <p>So what's been happening in the past few weeks. Let's start with my pet hate subject, public transport. The ticker sign on the front and back on each coach pleads us to keep our mobile phone conversations to a minimum volume. To keep them. To a minimum. Volume. Not to make sure that everyone on the carriage knows who you fancy and that you demand to know why that report won't be in your desk in "10-15 minutes when you're in the office". I could go on my phone such as this:</p>
<p>"Alright mate? Yeah, not bad, not bad. I was just dying to know whether you shagged that bird you were talking to on Saturday. You did, eh! Attaboy! Of course she was gagging for it, that much I get. If it weren't for you, someone else would have filled in the slot. So, to business. How many times did you... MOTHERFUCKING GET OUT OF HERE! You shit me not!? Heheh, good man, mate, good man! Just next time remember to give'er one in my favour. Just to honour our friendship. Cool, man, cool. I'll speak to you soon. Bye."</p>
<p>Well, it does sound funny.</p>
<p>The voice over woman who announces the stations the train calls at sounds the same as the voice over woman who announces the bus stop the bus has been requested a stop for and the woman who happily innstructs us to go to our collection point in Argos. I wonder if these voice-over people ever give interviews, same as the woman who did an interview and does the voice-overs for Athens's Metro.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm sure morning's commuters must hate my guts to death when they hear my recorded voice saying that there is a platform alteration to the train which is due in one minute and that 80 people are waiting for. I'm currently living under 24-hour police protection. I mean I don't have it as bad as Geert Wilders or Ayaan Hirsi Ali but still."<br />
I notice fewer of those posters showing two cartoons saying towards the passenger that they will not eat smelly food or that they'll keep their feat off   vacant seats or whatever. To be completely honest, only after seeing those posters did I pontificate whether eating smelly food on the bus or train is a bad practice. After 14 hours in the office or after a big night out you just have to swing by Burger King, fight off a few chav shits who want to get a bit familiar with you and get a juicy quadruple whopper when your train is 5 minutes out. Apparently it is bad etiquette after all.</p>
<p>Speaking of chav shits, I don't think I've seen a poster with an ibred-looking cartoon saying "I will not shout at other passengers or talk to myself or throw chips around". I suppose that files under the "if you become witness of antisocial behaviour please call this number" notice which is very near the other posters. I suppose what they're going to do is chopper in within a minute of your phone call, storm the coach's doors and fire a couple rounds into the chav's chest. If that preferable option is not feasible they have to have cops or rail enforcement officers at the next station or the one next to it shoud they miss the train.</p>
<p>Those of the "antisocial behaviour" exhibitors who aren't reported or escape arrest wind up in a tourist resort in Greece a few months later. Thankfully, hundreds of miles away from my hometown.</p>
<p>Their capital is the Burger King inside Charing Cross rail station. At least their single brain cell is enough of white matter to dictate to them that they should queue for their burger. It is, however, not enough to instruct them that they must not treat the person in front of or behind them as if they're best mates. If you stay away from council flats, which I presume that you do since you are at least articulate enough to read this text, the Burger King in Charing Cross station -( bit more difficult but not impossible) and, finally, Southeastern Rail trains (for many reasons other than this too) then you're in the clear.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that chav behaviour should be met with punitive force and not seen as a disease that needs to be cured.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I phoned up BT to talk about my broadband connection which was never activated. That wasn't the first time I called them for the same reason. The first time I tried they promised they'll let their order management department know about my siuation and someone will ring me on my mobile. Never happened. The second time, I got redirected to every conceivable BT department with many waiting intervals in between. 43 minutes after I dialed their number, my phone's battery died out and I had to leave for work. Which brings us to today.</p>
<p> I spent about 35 minutes hearing that they are sorry, but they "are very busy at the moment" and that my call will be answered "as soon as possible". At least they were decent enough to drop the "your call is important to us" bullshit. Because, clearly, if my call were important to them, they would have hired more staff to keep the call queue shorter. I considered the ringback option for a moment (if the call queue is too long, you can select the ringback option and they say they'll call you back within a hour), but I remembered two occassions a few years ago when I did so and no one deigned to ring me back. So I decided to wait.</p>
<p> So, 35 minutes on, a rather peeved third worlder said something that I didn't clearly understand, not least because I had the phone on speaker and was caught a bit off guard partly because of it, and partly because I thought the sales department was based in the UK.  After much deliberation and many intermissions folllowed by "thank you for staying on the line" - like I have much of a choice - he said that a manager would call me on my mobile within 48 hours. Thinking that the previous case was an one-off, I agreed but I decided to take a shot and ask him what exactly the problem with my line was.</p>
<p> "It's fairly technical and even if I could spend an hour explaining it to you, you still wouldn't understand," the third worlder snaps.</p>
<p> I'll tell you why I didn't snap back "Mate, I work in IT and telecoms so you can take  a shot if you like". First off, you do want to be on the good book of a bunch of third worlders who know where you live. Second, imagine being confined in a chair with space as much as that of an economy class airplane seat somewhere in Bangalore and have a middle class twat half a planet away shouting abuse at you. Third, I believe that most of these people genuinely want to help but they are allowed/have the capability to do only so much.</p>
<p> That happened a week ago and no one called me back.</p>
<p> I dreaded going with TalkTalk or Tiscali or whatever the bloody hell it's called these days, Bulldog, if it hasn't yet gone bust or any of the other small providers as I would trust all of them combined just as I would trust a cat next to my hamster uncaged. With BT I still had a chance since I've been with them three times and have never had problems with them. Granted, their broadband speed is fucking slow but unless I was willing to pay Sky's exorbitant "one-off set up fees" and a TV package I don't need, BT was the next best thing. In fact, there was an article in the paper last December titled "UK broadband slower than Greece". You just know that things are utterly fucked when you hear something like that. Every time I visit family I am surprised by the fast speed a video stream is buffered from the web. The fastest broadband I've had here was with Sky and you can still tell the difference.</p>
<p> "Which are your favourite TV shows sir?"</p>
<p> This is a question I would expect on a first date and not by someone at a call centre. I knew where this was going but I answered regardless. "Yeah, I watch 24, FlashForward... that sort of thing. What is it to you?"</p>
<p> "I'd like to inform you of an offer we have on BT Vision this month only."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not interested."</p>
<p> "May I ask why you're not interested?"</p>
<p> "Oh that's rich. I've already ordered a service from you that isn't working but at least the telly will work and you want my money off that, is that it? There is a very specific reason why I called you guys. If I wanted TV I would have ordered a box already, but obviously this is not the case."</p>
<p> I don't know why I've even bothered. I presume most of these call centre workers get picked off the street and only know how to deal with textbook problems so I normally go easy on them. But this one was fair game. He got even more peeved when I declined his offer and asked me for a reason and I showed great restraint so as not to say anything bad about his country of origin. But in any case I never forget that I'm dealing with a person. A person that none the less at the time of their shift represents a huge cumbersome being that you cannot take on and judging by the horror stories I've read on teh interwebs it will many times play hard to get. Unless you cancel your direct debit and make them chase you for their money. When the Indian told me that someone'll call me within 48 hours and that didn't happen then I knew that they could no longer play me like that. I called them on me day off on Friday when I knew that most people would be at work and I would get through to someone quickly.</p>
<p> Bottom line: I got a new activation date for my broadband. If I don't get it, there's the High Complaints department. Then it's Oftel. Or Ofcom. Or whatever the bloody hell they're called these days.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I've been tied up with various shit lately. You know you've been away from blogging for too long when they've changed the home page so much that you think you've mistyped the URL. I've been meaning to write something about office Christmas parties for about a week now, since we've had ours, but due to the verbosely described reasons above, I postponed it until today.</p>
<p>I googled the following terms the other day:<br />
"office christmas party" "do I have to go"<br />
"office christmas party" "don't want to go"<br />
"avoid the office christmas party"</p>
<p>I suppose I was trying to locate a genuine, heart-to-heart anonymous rant by someone who is due for his annual office Christmas party but would prefer to jump off a cliff instead. I did found one on the first page and even that didn't expand much on the subject but it grasped the meaning of not going to the party. The other search results in pages 1 and 2 strongly instruct you to go. I didn't bother with page three and beyond since I thought that if it's not on the first two pages, obviously someone's ranting about their upcoming office Christmas party wasn't deemed important by most google visitors, hence... I don't know. I'm sure it isn't the case that everyone is looking forward to that. Who is longing to see their collegues in various stages of sobriety by the end of the evening, raise glass with the man who had been berating them in front of a client only 4 days ago in order to make an impression to said client and generally spend as many as many as 7 hours that could be spent in valuable, personal time, with the people they see at least 40 hours a week, 48 weeks a year?</p>
<p>Most of these websites assume that you can turn up anytime you want "but not as soon as the party starts",  and that you can leave anytime you want "but stay at least two hours". None mentions what you could do differently in the case that a cab fleet has been called to pick up all the staff immediately after work, and another will do the same at the end of the evening (which is 1:30am) and everyone is expected to turn up for work at 9am the next day?</p>
<p>There's not much you can do there. As much as I hate office Christmas parties or any other work function that involves anything more than a swiftie at the local boozer, I believe that if you don't understand why you must go then you should submit your resignation on the spot. What you do there is your prerogative. Me, I normally glom on the people with whom I'm kind of familiar and that's it. You can text or phone people who aren't there all night long if you like. But go you must.</p>
<p>At some point I was texting a friend who wasn't there and telling her about my plight. She replied with "I don't go to office christmas parties cos I can't be bothered. I don't care what my colleagues think of me. I have bigger worries. If you don't want to come you don't have to provide a reason to your boss. It's none of their business. Sod them all and go home."</p>
<p>Fair enough. Don't you think? Why didn't I think of that myself? This would work out perfectly. Apart from the fact that even if attending office parties isn't part of your contracted duties, you still should go because it's part of your unofficial duties.  Yes, there are those too. Why are they not on your contract? Do you think you would take seriously your employment if your contract read something in the lines of:</p>
<p>1. To design and develop software applications<br />
2. To design and develop the back end database(s) to support the applications<br />
3. To thoroughly test and debug software applications designed and developed by the Company<br />
4. To maintain in-house software applications throughout their life cycle.<br />
5. To attend the Company's annual Christmas function where every employee is required to remain in the venue until 1:30am and resume duties in precisely 7.30 hours after the end of the function.</p>
<p>Perhaps clause 5 is not there because when I signed up we did Christmas lunches at the time. Yet, not even that is in my contract.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. However, you can do all those other things we mentioned. Even if you should go to the office Christmas party, there's no obligation on your part to talk to anyone and be animated and friendly. Do your thing and let them wonder why you don't mingle.</p>
<p>I'm a very miserable bastard at work, bordering on subhuman, some would say. At the office party, I was beastly even after a few Budweisers, which isn't like me. This has no correlation with the tone of my writings here. I'm definitely not grumpy - except for the times that I am - and I don't only find ills with the world - although I do find a huge lot of them. It's just that I and many others like me can't help but spot the ludicrous in situations that those non-afflicted regard as normal. We take amusement or irritation in things that seem to slip everyone else by. For example, when they tell us that with your "triple play" communications package you get a free digital tv decoder, but the "one-off set up fee" is £60 and their competitor does not have a set up fee but the monthly cost is a little bit higher. You see a pack of lamb loins with a big yellow sign that says "Buy one get one free" and you think that just one pack is already overpriced. You read on the paper "pregnant teen dies of swine flu" and wonder if anyone else reading this thought "two fewer chavs on benefit".</p>
<p>It is in that sense that my bed has two wrong sides. Of course, being that and a miserable bastard are not two mutually exclusive things.</p>
<p>In fact I tried, yes, I tried to have a little fun as well. Like try and hit on the boss's lovely secr... err... office manager. Just a bit of harmless flirting with no expected outcome. She is, after all, a co worker. Ok, maybe I pushed it a little too far, knowing that I won't be trying something like that with her until the next Christmas Party, if I go and if I'm still working in the same company, but I wasn't inclined to do anything serious, and she was even less so.</p>
<p>A few metres away there was a 50+ drunk bird who was rubbing some younger bloke's todger over his trousers. Just what one needs on a weeknight. But it was nice to see that she's still got it in her.</p>
<p>Next year, the company should pay us to go out to different parties seperately, on Friday night. Yeah, that's the ticket.</p>
