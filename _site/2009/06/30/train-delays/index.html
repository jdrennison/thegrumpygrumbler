      <p>You should have seen me puff when fast pacing to the train station this morning. I got on the train after all but only because it was to stay on the station for 10 minutes before it was cleared for departure. And this is where realisation came down.</p>
<p>You will probably agree that this city has far too many people. Imagine what your life in London would be like if the population here was 40% less than it is now. Yes, I know it's mostly immigrants like me who make things worse but what would you have done in my place? Anyway, it's times like these when you realise how overcrowded this place is. It's a scene that repeated itself many times before. The train remains stationary indefinitely whilst we are standing inside crammed like sardines and those of us who can get a glimpse at the platform can see everyone else who arrives later than us and scans the train doors cursorily. We all hope that whatever they plan to do will involve moving down the platform and trying another door. Some of them do. Some others want to become your enemy, mumble a cursory "excuse me" and get in through the same door you did and squeeze themselves next to you.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, the temperature is 25C and some "fellow" passengers didn't take a shower before leaving for work. This means that while you leave your house squeaky clean, by the time you get to the office you smell other people's scents and your coworkers will have to endure that for at least 8 hours.</p>
<p>I'm surprised that everyone takes this without  complaint. I remember when I had to do this in my country. Now, anyone who has visited Greece must have realised we are a very gregarious people. A similar scene at a train station during rush hour would be amusing to say the least.</p>
<p><em>"Move down the train, we can't get inside"</em></p>
<p><em>"Well, lady, you can see we're packed. Try another door."</em></p>
<p><em>"Why, I still see some space there somewhere."</em></p>
<p><em>"There's no space, go somewhere else"</em></p>
<p><em>"For Christ's sake!" (tries to squeeze in, pisses off everybody she pushes) </em></p>
<p><em>"Which part of 'piss off' don't you understand?"</em></p>
<p><em>(Loudly)"Well, you have the manners of a fucking Paki(*), you know that? Is that what you are? A smelly Paki?"</em></p>
<p>A trip by tube had to ensue next as I was going to be late for work otherwise. It's far worse down under as there is no fresh air to come through the windows.</p>
<p>This photo was taken 11 hours later back in London Bridge.</p>

<p>I normally associate all those "Delayed" notifications with a movie where a catastrophic terrorist attack is imminent and all flights or train services have been put on hold until the affected area is cleared. Later on, "Delayed" becomes "Cancelled", which means that conventional means failed to take down the terrorist threat and the protagonist must come in. I didn't stay in London Bridge long enough to see "Delayed" change to anything else.</p>
<p>The official story was that there was a lineside fire in the London Bridge area. It was either that or someone wanted to call it an early evening and came up with that elaborate excuse. I mean, does anyone really and truly know what a "lineside fire" even mean other that it's something that emerges just make you see your partner and kids with a two hour delay?</p>
<p>It may have taken them one hour to resume the trains, it could still be going on. Fuck in heaven knows. I can visualise the railtrack repairmen work 15 minutes at a time and take 45 minute long tea breaks in between and all that while getting paid by the hour. After all, it's not like we can somehow retaliate. Can we switch from our current provider and buy monthly travelcards to use with a different railway company that uses different, weather and fire-resistant railways and trains with larger people capacity that get us where we want to go without any delays? If we get to work 35 minutes late can we advise our friends not to use Southeastern Rail because, say, company XYZ does the same route but is on time more often for 3/4 of the current monthly fare? Can we balls.</p>

<p>(*) Back home we're still allowed to talk like that. In public. Regardless whether Pakistani immigrants are around and listening. And I can attest that this exchange did happen.</p>
