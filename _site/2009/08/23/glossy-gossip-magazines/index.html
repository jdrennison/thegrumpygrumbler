      <p>As I was doing my grocery shopping, those strategically placed colourful magazines caught my eye. Although, honestly, even if they weren't so strategically placed, they could still be spotted from anywhere in the shop being so bright that in the event of a blackout they could easily light up the place. </p>
<p> Imagine being a grocery store clerk and you are restocking the place: "Hey Ngozi, we need to put the latest version of "Heat" next to the till queue area. These old hags who shop here have a memory that fails with age, so let put those mags there to be sure to sell them." </p>
<p> Anyway, there was a big caption in one of them that read something in the lines of "Pete speaks his mind and tells all".  First of all, they assume we all know who "Pete" is. I wouldn't know, if it weren't for his wife (is she still his wife?) whose cleavage stars frequently in the covers of said magazines. I didn't even know that he's a singer. Before I found out, he had only earned the attribute of "the famous guy who has married the glamour model with the big tits". Basically defining him through his famous wife. Pretty much in the same manner as how we came to identify Sharon Osbourne's husband ever since he stopped recording anything of essence. </p>
<p> Basically, it's not a bad thing, having the world know that you shag a glamour model with big tits. Yes, she may be a total airhead. She may be an avowed chav. Yet, it's not a bad thing for one single reason alone. </p>
<p> As the late Don LaFontaine would say, in a world where you're judged by how handsome you are, how much you earn and how pretty is the chick you bonk, you could be the scourge of humanity, an untalented bastard. That means jack shit. Yet you get the big-titted glamour model and become the envy of the male population? All these millions of peasants settle for what they can get while the hottest of the hottest will only look at the likes of pop  singers. That's why they have their faces in the magazines. To remind you where you stand in the social chain and where they do. The personality and how decent the character of their partners are, are not important. They have money and fame and 70% of the world population is looking up to them. </p>
<p> You would think that I'm jealous. For one thing, I know i would never become a pop singer or a model or a footballer. I do the job I think I can do better than any other. Singing is something I'd like to do as a hobby but I don't think it's exactly a rational career to be a pop star or a glamour model so, I've left these two out. What bothers me is exactly the fact that i work just as hard as a performer on european tour, yet I earn 6 times less than he/she does. Of course, I'm not as expendable as they are nor do I have to deal with the circuit of their industries, but still. </p>
<p> The other thing is the wife. How many non-famous men out there can honestly claim that if they could be with virtually any woman that they desire, they would choose to stay with their existing partner? Do we conciously choose the best woman while turning down far better looking women while they would fall hell over heels for us or do we settle for what we can get? </p>
<p> Anyway, those magazines follow the lives of people we don't know and care and who will never get to know what we do in our lives. Yet I suppose they sell a lot of copies. There are two cases at play here. Both apply to those who settle for whatever they can get. 1)They see famous people and their beutiful wives/handsome husbands and live the life they're not living by following what they do. 2) They read their breakup stories nodding their head thinking 'tsk tsk, he got married to a chav glamour model with big tits and silicone lips, what did he expect, did he really think he would keep her or what? At least I'm with my below-average-looking wife who is down to earth, but come to think about it I'd like to do Katie at least once'. </p>
