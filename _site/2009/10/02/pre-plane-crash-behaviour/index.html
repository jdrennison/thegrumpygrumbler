      <p>I truly wish for no more plane crashes although we all know they will happen. Every time I'm on a plane and especially at the time the plane takes off, I have that notion of what I must do in case I'm up there and something bad happens. We'll hear the captain's voice on the speaker and he'll say something along the following lines: </p>
<p> "Ladies and gentlemen, I must inform you with regret that the luggage compartment has been decompressed and we are losing oxygen. Also, debris from inside the luggage compartment have been sucked into both of the aircraft engines and we cannot keep up the aircraft. There is still a chance we can get out of this alive as long as you remain seated with your seatbelt fastened and brace when you are told to do so by the cabin or the cockpit crew. I will not lie to you; the chances of our survival are very slim but we will do everything humanly possible to land you safely. Thank you for your understanding and wait for further instructions." </p>
<p> Would many people remain in their seats if that announcement were to be made? I know that in very few occasions people have survived plane crashes and I  would  probably do as the pilot said. Part of me, though, wants to find the strength to defy the crew's instructions, quickly look around the cabin to find a pretty female and approach her with the ultimate chat up line a-la Airplane: The Movie. </p>
<p> "Hi there. You know, it's quite likely that these are our last moments. I've noticed you from a few rows behind and I find you quite cute. Mind if I sit next to you for a while? Though we'd better be quick. By  the way, and i'm talking to you, you old whore sitting next to her, you are ousted to the fucking aisle". </p>
<p> I wish I, and everyone else on the planet, will never find ourselves in that situation. Just in case, though, if you've spotted a single person you fancy in the boarding gate try and see where he/she is going to sit in the cockpit and sit next to him/her. Failing that, once you get into the aircraft scan the already seated passengers. That'll save you a trip to his/her seat, thus inconvenience nearby passengers in their last moments. </p>
<p> You can always ask a steward/stewardess, of course. That applies mostly to us men as there is always at least one tasty stewardess on the plane. </p>
