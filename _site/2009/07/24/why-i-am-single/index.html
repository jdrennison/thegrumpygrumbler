      <p>I haven't written anything for a while, not because I haven't found things to be grumpy about (in fact, as my bed has two wrong sides, I can always find things to be grumpy about), but indeed because there are so many I don't know where to start. That, combined with 11 hour work days makes me think I need to do something more constructive with my ever limiting free time. Even more constructive than log anything preposterous I see in order to see nodding heads, that is. However, today this is the most constructive thing I figured I can do for the day.</p>
<p>If you're my age or older you're either married or most of your friends are  married with or without children or in a serious relationship. I don't know how you feel about that. Me, I'm totally indifferent. I couldn't care less.</p>
<p>There is the perception that all men, and I mean ALL men, are sharks who want to get a fling before they settle down with the woman of their life. Maybe that's true, but some of us prefer to spend our time in hobbies we know and tried instead of in women. I think of myself as someone who lives a fulfilling life without having to search for that special someone. Although I do want to settle with the right woman in the distant future I'm resisting all social pressure to pursue a fling. Because this is what it's all about.</p>
<p>I want to be able to live in a world where nobody thinks that there must be a reason why you're single while 30+. I want to live in a world where when you tell a fellow bloke of your last night out, he doesn't jump in to ask you "nice one geezer, did you pull any birds?", but rather if the musicwas good or if the drinks weren't spiked or how the guy who tried to take my turn at Burger King reacted when I said to him that his mom left her flip-flops at my house.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I'm merely enjoying myself during the limited spare time I've got per week and if the right woman comes along, so much the better. If not, c' est la vie. Casual flings, they're not for me, unless they involve older women with whom I know I can't have a relationship.</p>
<p>I guess I'm something a prospective girlfriend would call a "commitment phobic". That's right. Whoever doesn't want to get married or to have a woman to tell you what time she expects you home, or do this and that or you're pretty much happy with your life when you just flirt about, is stuck with the clinical condition of "commitment-o-phobia". Mind you I've also met women who suffer from "commitment-o-phobia". I don't know if they get the attention of women who don't suffer from it, perhaps not so much as we "commitment-phobic" men draw most oftheir fire.  I don't know if you can get something from over-the-counter to mitigate the symptoms and even if there is, it's most likely placebo.</p>
<p>Normally I don't make a song and dance about the merits of my single life but whoever asks, learns.  This time I made an exception as a fellow bachelor may find his way to this blog and read this and nod in agreement.</p>
