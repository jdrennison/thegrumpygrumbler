    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>I'm out of the country for two weeks for some long awaited holidays. It's a bit sad that we have come to a point that we need time away from work to feel alive again, but this is the state of affairs we're in. You're confined in an office at least 10 hours a day, sometimes you work from home when you get back. You spend the weekend to do washing-up, grocery shopping, cooking, go to the council swimming pool (I don't count physical exercise as leisure) spend an hour going out for drinks and dinner and an hour to go home, do other things that take turns once every month or every other month and this leaves you maybe with 5-6 hours to yourself on Saturday and the same for Sunday. Repeat the above steps until you're 68.</p>
<p>Away from the grind, then, and here I am at the airport. Upon entering the terminal, I exchanged glances with a police officer with a bulletproof vest on, holding what I think is a submachine gun. I was quite surprised that he hadn't had a partner. If gunfire erupts, which I assume the authorities deem possible otherwise this man would be holding a baton, how far is the backup? Anyhow, I will assume that they're know what they're doing.</p>
<p>Past the Easyjet kiosks I walk. Now, I might mention that every time I think Easyjet, I think the geezer who owns it, one Stelios Hatjiioannou. Wikipedia describes him as a "British entrepreneur" but his accent is worse than mine. My dad saw him on a tennis court in Greece once, with his entourage which consisted of a few bodyguards with handguns. I felt I could have done with something like that when I lived in the more dodgy areas of London. But I'm digressing now again, as I always do, so I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>The lady at the kiosk checks your passport and then asks you some "security questions". Now I realize that this is very serious and you're not allowed to make a joke when you reply. There was in fact the case of that Greek male glamour model whose name now escapes me, who, after a series of photo shoots in London, when he was checking in for his return flight he said that he was carrying a bomb on his hand luggage. He had been banned from the country for many years after that trip of his.</p>
<p>Which is a bit bad, really, 'cos there's some good fun you can have at that point. "Did anyone gave you anything to carry in your luggage on their behalf?" "Yep, that dark-skinned bearded man gave me a metallic cylinder which had a 'nuclear hazard' sign on it but it's just a small cylinder so I didn't give it much thought and took it with me." Instead, I try to keep a straight face and go no, no and no to anything they ask me.</p>
<p>Before you enter security, you have to rummage your hand luggage and part with any liquid container that had capacity of 100ml or more. I don't know why they chose that limit instead of, say, 75 or 89. Is it because it's a good-looking round number? I've had a spectacle cleaning spray confiscated before, as well as shampoo when I was only travelling with hand luggage. At that area you can see some humongous plastic bags all containing confiscated cosmetic liquids, shampoos and the like. Items which, as we're told from the airport megaphones, will be later on destroyed. Yet we all suspect what will happen to them a few hours later: Items that until now had been treated as potential bomb ingredients will go next to the vanity mirrors in the houses of the 16-year-olds who confiscated them in the first place, after they have shared the booty.</p>
<p>The next step is the x-rays of your hand luggage and possibly your frisking. Nothing new there. What is, new, however is the additional x-ray scanners that has been installed just at the entrance of the duty-free shopping mall. That is for examining shoes. And so, my friends, you see the merits of multi-fucking-culturalism in Europe. Richard Reid paved the road by attempting to blow up the plane he was on by detonating a "shoe bomb". Then those other bastards  attempted to blow up some other transatlantic flights and they're the reason why we now drink overpriced bottled water in the airport terminal. If in any of my future flights I encounter a dark-skinned man with a big hooked nose inside the aircraft, I wonder if I can muster up enough courage to walk up to him and say "Hola señor, como está?" and if he doesn't answer demand that he is removed from the motherfucking plane immediately.</p>
<p>As you then make your way to the aircraft via the tube that takes you there, you will no doubt see the famous HSBC posters with a series of photos and large one-word captions on them that alternate between the photos on the wall. The message they want to get across is that there is variety in life because people have different points of view. Which is great, but not always. For example, since this all takes place in an airport, will we see a future ad campaign that portrays a man wired with explosives inside a passenger aircraft just moments before he hits the detonator, then another one next to it with a Middle Eastern village being carpet bombed and the words "terrorist" and "liberator" taking turns in the two photos? They say that a man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter so an ad like this would make a lot of sense. For me, in many cases, like this one for instance, there should be only one point of view. Multiple points of view are great but up to a point. I guess where I'm driving at is that if most people were like me I would get out of my house a lot more often.</p>
<p>Inside the aircraft we are told to switch off all electronic devices during takeoff and landing including mobile phones with flight mode on. So you're confined in a space that can barely take in your volume, only sitting upright for three hours will enable you ti fit in there nicely and to add insult to injury you cannot use your phone's mp3 player to pass the time. I still don't believe that a technologically advanced aircraft that can carry 300 people with their baggage up to 35000 feet, equipped with one of the the most complex circuitry  and navigation system man has created can be "confused" and plummet to the ground taking us all to our deaths just because your parents call you to check how you are getting on on the plane. Yeah. Right. Yet you think that you don't really want to find yourself with a court date so you just comply. Now, come to think about it, I wrote a couple of things on this entry that could land me in court. Upon my return to the UK, could I face capital punishment or a large fine or have my reputation destroyed by the media just for saying that we let people in from far away lands into Europe, bringing their disputes here, some of them going as far to realizing their disputes as blowing up aircraft or Tube trains.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the flights to and from Greece have gone quieter. It used to be the case that i always happened to sit next to some first-year Greek student who for some reason thought I like some chit-chat to pass the time. These days seem to be gone and that's good.</p>
<p>Another good thing is that farts don't smell on the plane.</p>
