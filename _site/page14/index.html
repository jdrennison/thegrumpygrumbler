    <p>Those "don't assault our staff" adverts are everywhere. For good reason indeed as there are plenty of <a title="We've talked about this before" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/human-wastelands/" target="_blank">subhuman cunts</a> who can't seem to know how to behave themselves. Today I saw another one on the DLR:</p>
<blockquote><p>I spat on a member of staff and thought nothing of it. A few months later, I was arrested.</p>
<p><em>Abuse, Assault, Arrest: Our staff are here to help you. Spitting on DLR staff is classified as an assault and is a criminal offence. Saliva Recovery Kits are now held on every train and will be used to identifty offenders against the national DNA database.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Let's get real here: The staff is not here to help us, they're here to put food on their table and maybe give some directions, although to take the DLR from A to B should be, as Americans would say, "a no brainer". But in any case they do have the right to work without the fear of threats or violence.</p>
<p>But the bottom line of this entry is that I can't for the life of me understand who in their right mind would spit on another human being who at the end of the day are just working their shift and want to get home to their families. Why would someone spoil another person's day like that? Especially in the DLR where interaction with staff is minimal. But apparently there are enough such incidents so that they put up those posters on DLR coaches.</p>
<p>What's next, chavs taking a shit on their palm and throwing it at rail staff?</p>

    <p>I am convinced at this point that I've got a magnet hidden in my torso that attracts those good for nothing arseholes in public places. If you've lived in London for a reasonably long time, you must have bumped into many of them. Those who want some change to top up their train fare (c' est la vie. Did you not plan your return beforehand?). Those who want a cigarette (go buy your fucking own). And those who are just being noisy.</p>
<p>They will make noise on the bus and on the train. Everytime I come across one of those I can't help but remind myself that in my country this indecent behaviour is a rare occurrence and we would always make short work of those bastards. Here, I decided that there is certain abuse that I can take without protesting if this means that they won't slit my throat with the switchblade they possibly pack. However, if anyone attempts to spoil my day while I'm out with a bird, that will be the end of their days. Either I'll end up in the hospital with knife wounds and a broken jaw or they will.</p>
<p>In the UK people are generally respectful of a stranger's boundaries except for a loud minority which when on the piss makes up for all the times it minds its own business. I haven't run the numbers but by the looks of it the minority is more than 30% of the general population. And a 75% of that bumps into me at night.</p>
<p>If I ever reach the point of beating up one of these nobodies and get a sentence for it, I wonder if I will feel a sense of pride. "Jailed for ridding the world of a pushy good-for-nothing yob", the Daily Star will read in its front page. I'd much rather not find out. In fact it shouldn't be a punishable crime to use disproportionate force to teach the poor "youth" that he/she must respect a man's personal space if this is the only way to get the message. You've got someone who is 1. drunk and 2. irrespectful towards fellow human beings. Two separate provocations that, when combined, ought in themselves to constitute a defence of justifiable homicide.</p>
<p>In public transport stations and hospitals there are mounted signs that read a variation of "We will always press for the strongest possible penalties against those who attack, threaten or abuse our staff". Perhaps this will deter many subhumans from assaulting or threatening staff, but quite a few won't give a toss. I am proposing a new sign that could be mounted on the trains that serve my home-work-home route:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We will always press for the strongest possible penalties against those who attack, threaten or abuse our staff. Also mind you that the J D Rennison takes this train home in the evenings. Our idea of "the strongest possible penalties" is  the same as his idea of "the most lenient possible penalties". But fear not; he only takes this route twice a day, so there's still a good change you won't come across him."</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Today I called NHS Direct to complain about a heart discomfort. I guess what I really wanted from them was a bit of reassurance, or a standard "Go see your GP" response and not for the call centre nurse to act all worried and insisting to call an ambulance to my work address.</p>
<p>"The symptoms you described to us look more like a case of an imminent heart failure and we would like to have you checked".</p>
<p>Heart failure... yeah, I knew those 14-hour work days would pay off some day. Well, if she's going to make us lose money at work by me not being there, I'd much prefer to save the minicab money and get chauffeured to the hospital in a large cab, courtesy of the NHS.</p>
<p>"I can still rush to casualty afterwards, someone else might need that ambulance more than I do, that's not a problem", I offered instead.</p>
<p>She repeated the same sentence she said before only with a different wording. When I was checking my symptoms on the netty I was worried enough to picture my desk with a wreath on it, so I decided to go with her suggestion.</p>
<p>One of the paramedics had earrings on both his ears and the other one was a redhead bird in her mid 40s with a large tat on her wrist. Imagine that. In most waiting job adverts they're asking for non-visible tats or piercings. Personally I couldn't care less if the waitress in Strada or Pizza Express has a few tats on her forearms but what sort of trust would two paramedics with tats and piercings inspire on you? I guess that's a government thing, that we mustn't be judgemental about someone's class, or ideology or creed. Moreover, it's a good thing that these people have found this thing to do, help other people in serious need, that is. If it hadn't been for that they might have be doing something else I'd much rather not know about. It almost brought to my mind a heated conversation my mom had with my little brother back in 2004:</p>
<p>"You haven't done a day's study in your life and you haven' got any qualification. Will you ever open the paper and look at the jobs section? There is an opening for ambulance drivers. Decent money," she had then said to my devil-may-care brother.</p>
<p>"Like fuck I'll be driving screaming, blooded, dying people around the town, mom!"</p>
<p>"And just what do you plan to do with your life? We all have to do something!"</p>
<p>Being a paramedic is not an easy thing, considerign also the abuse they must be taking from human wastelands, so I'm glad these two people turned their lives around like that. If they ever read this, I'd like to offer the my apologies for not taking the time to thank them for the good job they did today.</p>
<p>"Was it you who called for the ambulance?" the female paramedic asked me while the guy was taking my blood pressure and measuring the oxygen in my blood.</p>
<p>"It was in fact the nurse I was talking to on NHS Direct"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, I should have known it was the NHS Direct. It's a phone. They can't examine you. We do. They want to call an ambulance even if you've began to sneeze. They're scaring everyone these days. 'A <em>chest pain is your body</em> saying call 999'. So everyone calls 999. Now, we've got the other advert about strokes. You know, the one with someone with a fire inside their head. I know they're trying to help people, but they end up frightening everyone."</p>
<p>Hey, good job, madam. Maybe I should make you a contributor to my blog. I'm no big fan of NHS direct but they're only a phone call away, compared to one's GP, whose availability must coincide with yours and that may happen at best no earlier than in two weeks time.</p>
<p>But she was right. If you're anything like me, the stroke advert should have made you utterly paranoid and constantly on stroke-watch. There are three chief symptoms you should watch out for in order to save lives:</p>
<p>1. Difficulty smiling</p>
<p>2. Can't lift their arms up</p>
<p>3. Slurred speech</p>
<p>Pretty much fits the profile of everyone I see on the train to work every morning. This is a pandemic that gives the swine flu a run for its money.</p>
<p>Maybe not so. There was no fire in their foreheads, so they fortunately got away with it.</p>
<p>As we were driving to the hospital, the female paramedic was asking me some demographic questions and was making notes.</p>
<p>"Is that information really necessary? Why do you need to know all this?"</p>
<p>She gave me a frowning look. "We do paperwork for each case," she said with contempt. After a long pause she added that she had asked for my next of kin's phone number should I die of complications. I said to her that's why I gave her the phone number of my family back in Greece rather than my flatmate's or some other acquaintance's here.</p>
<p>Then she went on harping on the nothing cases they had been called to attend to. A girl having her first period ever. A broken nail. I didn't know someone would receive an ambulance service for cases like these. "Oh, everyone is entitled to an ambulance service these days", she exhaled.</p>
<p>"But don't they tell us all the time that if we can make our own way to the hospital we should do so rather than call..."</p>
<p>"Oh we've tried that, nobody listens. We've even distributed leaflets that show an ambulance next to a minicab. That way, people might get to know what each looks like".</p>
<p>Indeed she should be a contributor here.</p>
<p> At that point I wanted in fact to change the subject and tell her that my last date was her age and had a tat of a snake just above her butt-crack but a) only half of this is true and b) she might not have appreciated it much. </p>
<p>We drove past a roadblock near Whitechapel. "Here, look, someone got hit by a car. If we  hadn't had to transfer you to the hospital we would have been called there now."</p>
<p>"C' est la vie. But I wouldn't want to be the car accident victim. Or could it be a gunshot victim?"  I said.</p>
<p>When we got to the hospital, I was immediately received by a doctor. Let me mention here that I've been to the A&amp;E before. In fact I go everytime I have an episode of hypohondria and feel that death or permanent disability may be looming faster than an appointment with my GP. And in the A&amp;E they treat you like a half-wit no matter who you are or what you do. I suppose they have an equal opportunity policy and must speak to each patient in the same manner, regardless of the patient's colour, creed or class. Good for them.</p>
<p> He took me to a bed and asked me a series of questions. Does it hurt when he presses here or there? Does the pain get worse when I lift up my arm making a circle? Good question. Let me concentrate on the pain and see if it is as he says.</p>
<p>"Listen, mate, and listen good, I've got five minutes to decide if your case is a serious or a non-serious one. It can be your heart failing or it can be something as simple as a strained muscle. These five minutes will mark the difference between your waiting one hour to see one set of doctors and four hours to see another set of doctors. It's very important that you follow my instructions."</p>
<p>I never disputed that for a second, actually. Imagine him, he must have been there for five hours already dealing with nutters like me and his patience threshold must have been exceeded. But perhaps he should have spared himself those five minutes and put me in the 4-hour queue straight away, just to be sure. And -surprise, surprise!- I was sent to go through the 4-hour process.</p>
<p>Well, what do you know! I was sent home with some painkillers with the doctors having ruled out the worst. That's what the attending doctor said to me: medicine is a science of exclusion. Yeah, I pretty much figured that out ever since I registered with a GP in this country. Now the next part is to face my boss tomorrow, who has started to suspect my case of hypohondria and will harp on the money that I've made him lose. Or shall I just tell him that this is all his own indirect fault?</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I saw a Star Trek poster in the tube today. For now, I'll let slide the out-of-time-place-and-franchise figure of James T. Kirk a-lá James Dean on a bike in the center of the poster and I'll focus on the one-line reviews that appear near the fringe of the image.</p>
<p>All movie posters have one-line comments on them that go by "Brilliant", "Exceptional", "If you get to see only one movie this year make it this one", you get the drift. I don't remember seeing so many comments on any poster other than Star Trek's. Alright, so a bunch of people who get paid to see movies are telling us which ones they like, using large letters. In case we don't get the message the first time, there's not one or two one-line comments but about 15 of them, just for good measure. Who knows, maybe they'll get to turn a few people around and go see the movie. Oh, will they bog roll.</p>
<p>I wonder what it would be like once to see a poster with the usual praising one-liners and a few others thrown in along the lines of "Don't even bother mate". I suppose there's no place for "movie critics" to swim among the sea of praising comments and try to warn us not to throw money away on something they watched and found repugnant.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think Zachary Quinto did so good a job that I couldn't think of him for a second as Sylar with pointy ears.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>The interest rate on my savings account had fallen on ridiculously low levels, so I went to my bank to ask for an explanation.</p>
<p>The exotic-looking fellow who offered me a seat at his desk said to me that “yes, indeed, sir, the interest rates have gone quite low in the past few months”. Oh, yes, the crisis.  Which, by the way, doesn’t explain why credit card interest rates haven’t also gone quite low. Nevertheless the exotic looking chap tried to sell me one, which I thought was a good idea to get as some web sites do not accept debit cards as payment. This is how they get you. You go to speak to your bank about an entirely different matter and they spin the conversation to credit cards.</p>
<p>I resisted the temptation to ask him how come credit card interest rates are still so extortionate  whilst I will have to look for a different savings option, if I want to make some money out of my existing money. The bloke booked me up for an appointment with an investment adviser for the next day and I went home to sleep on it.</p>
<p>Next day mid-day, I was in the same branch again, being seen by a middle aged man who was speaking the “Queen’s English” but had a last name that I think was Armenian. The Indian from the day before asked if he can observe, presumably because he was an investment adviser in the making and wanted to get another glimpse of how it’s done. The middle aged man presented me with a line graph with various figures about how equities, government bonds, cash and another couple of investments have done in the last 15-20 years.</p>
<p>Now if you’re like me (similar age, similar life experience and job field other than finance/banking/money related) then you probably don’t know jack shit about any of this.  I gave all those terms a whirl at Wikipedia and just to confirm that it’s not that I can’t understand anything because English isn’t my first language, I then tried it in Greek and to my horror I realised I had the same difficulty. You want to trick me into handing you my money so I don’t see it again, you’ve found the right person.</p>
<p>I resigned from my effort to understand what the man was narrating to me and in him I began to see a sleazy bastard who was clearly on a mission to rob me of the money that I worked hard to put away since I arrived to the country.</p>
<p>“Can I stop you there”, I said, “I’m only after a savings account to put my money away to since the interest rates on the one I’ve got are pretty much as low as my current account’s these days.”</p>
<p>“Oh I thought you said to me yesterday that you wanted to discuss a 3-5 year plan for your saved money”, his younger colleague said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I slept on it and I think I’m better off locking it away for the short term”, I said.</p>
<p>I understand that we are in the midst of a crisis and bank clerks are workers too, trying to to their job. They deserve our sympathy and not our scold, which is why I didn’t shoot them down.</p>
