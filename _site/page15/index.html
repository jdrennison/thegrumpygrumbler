  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In the past year or so, either I go get my daily latte at Nero’s, Starbucks’s or Costa’s they ask me if I want “anything to eat with that”. This, while I hadn’t even so much as glanced at the savoury section.</p>
<p>Truth is, if I wanted a muffin with my latte, I would have asked for “a regular latte and a double choc muffin please”, but I didn’t, now did I? Yet I can see the reasoning behind this. I almost always respect other people’s jobs (except if they’re council jobsworths) but on this one I can identify since  because I also worked in a coffee bar for some time. The story is that your boss explicitly instructs you to use “suggestive selling” on customers, that is make them buy more than they came in for. At the time I needed the extra money from that job, so I just went with it. Naturally, customers would most of the time decline but none had ever berated me. I suppose on my shifts I had met all those who respect other people’s jobs and what they have to endure to put food on the table.</p>
<p>I know it’s annoying and the barista treats you like you don’t know what you want, but he’s got a boss too and he is probably watching. Look at the bright side; there is no excuse for them to ask you if you want “anything else”. Picture this, you’ve just ordered your coffee or sandwich or whatever, they take it out of the food stall, put in in a paper bag, wrap it in a napkin and hand it over to you. Then they ask you if you would like anything else to which you always say no. I’m probably not the first person that am asked this question on a particular day. You would think that by now the clerk must have worked out that very, very few people would go to a coffee bar to order a regular cappuccino and a raisin scone but only verbally ask for the capuccino and hold back on the scone knowing that the clerk will ask them if they’d like “anything else” first. Besides, what if the clerk forgets? Well, fear not. In several food chains and coffee bars I’ve lately seen signs which read a variation of this: “if we don’t suggest that you have this or that with your order, you will get your meal for free”.</p>
<p>That should be relieving.</p>

    <p>I was at Starbucks yesterday doing some reading on the new ASP.NET MVC Framework. Or should I say attempting to do some reading as there were a couple of toddlers screaming well past my earphones, stomping on the floor while running around behind me and sometimes coming too close to me while holding their empty cups formerly filled with kids’ beverages to make me think that they would accidentally launch them towards my laptop’s screen, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.</p>
<p>I wonder if I would be greeted as a hero if I were to approach the oldest of the toddlers and ask him nicely if he knew who Herod the Great was, or perhaps made a suggestion to their mom to buy some weed and roll them a joint to keep them sedated every time they visited a public café. Seriously, parents, your kids are cute to you only.  The rest of use couldn’t give more of a shit if you paid us to.</p>

    <p>You’ve got to love those third worlders(*) that staff the cash till in cornershops. If you’re a bloke you’ve no doubt been called “boss” at least once by one of them if they’re a bloke also.</p>
<p>Well, if I were their boss they would  be given the bloody sack on the spot.</p>
<p>(*) It’s ok to call a restaurant waiter an “exam failure” behind their back, but calling a cornershop clerk a “third worlder” is not ok? Quite a few waiters don’t do this job by virtue of having failed an exam, but can you claim that the vast majority of convenience store clerks in London are not third worlders?</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I felt relieved at the fact I left the office so early in about a year; 6.30 pm. I was at the train station at a few minutes to 7 waiting for the 19:00 train home. It never showed up. The next one was at 19:10 so I waited. After making sure that the electronic announcement board mentioned the station I wanted to get off to, I got in.  It was the wrong train after all.</p>
<p>I got off at the first station the train stopped and which was a few tens of miles from where I wanted to get off. I went to the opposite platform to get on the next train that was going in the same direction I came from and would come in no earlier than 25 minutes.</p>
<p>You know the story; it’s rush hour, everybody is fighting off a few hundreds of other people on the train platforms trying to find a free slot behind the yellow line, there’s noise, commotion and you’ve had 9rough hours at work. You won’t notice anything as petty as the company branding or the interior of the train and how different these two are from the ones on the trains you normally take to and from work. Besides, it’s rush hour and some companies service may be serving some extra routes for all I know.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ended up at the outer boundaries of Zone 6 and my main concern was whether I was going to bump into a conductor on my way back as I wasn’t going to paya single extra penny for a mistake I’m solely putting the blame on them? At this instance it’s the company that manages the station from which I take the train home. Well, come to think about it I might as well lay the blame to all the other passengers that get in my way by having the preposterous idea of returning to their homes at the same time as I. What wouldn’t I give to find a desolate platform on which I can walk around freely while waiting for a non-delayed train to come and take me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It’s good to have peace of mind in case it hits the fan. Private treatment could cost you thousands of pounds if you want to bypass the NHS waiting lists. In the UK there are a number of medical insurers that take care of this for a monthly fee.</p>
<p>Now anyone who has any type of insurance or is looking to buy one, knows one truth that you won’t see on any medical insurance advice website: most don’t give you a quote online, rather you have to phone them so they can pull a “hard sell” approach on you. And by fuck, are they pushy. Just so you know. It would be just nice to do it all online, comparing the fine print and choosing the policy and company that fit you. Not so. Once you phone a company to get a quote, one of their “advisors” will be out to get you and you’ll have to be cruel to be kind. Even then they won’t give up easily. I wonder what goes down when they receive their training. Their instructor probable gives them clear directives: to keep pestering one’s balls until they buy or say something about them or their families.</p>
<p>That reminds me a of week ago when I had to shoo off a saleswoman whose policy I decided to postpone buying. Actually I thought the only way to be left alone is to tell her that I’m not interested at all.</p>
<p>“Sorry to hear that, is there something that has changed your mind?” she asked. Well, quite a few things, is what I didn’t answer. Such as me giving them an inch (asking for a quote on the phone) and them taking a mile (phoning you repeatedly during office hours and generally think they can be a leech on you).</p>
<p>I’m not saying not to buy PMI, but take your time to compare cos some of these contracts are cunning. You don’t want to chase them for a payment while you’re holding your chest in pain now do you?</p>
