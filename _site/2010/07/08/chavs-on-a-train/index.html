      <p>There were two chav girls on the train yesterday morning one of them yelling on the phone about the barbeque she went to the night before.</p>
<p>Then a lady in her early fifties told her off.</p>
<p>The chav girl hung up and said "It's only you who is moaning, no one else".</p>
<p>"I'm sure a lot of other people feel that way but are too polite to speak up"</p>
<p>Me, on the other hand, while I agree that a lot of other people, myself included, feel that way, they would much rather stay quiet than risk physical confrontation with someone who could carry a blade for all they know. Granted, it was 8:30 am, the two chavs were not intoxicated and didn't look belligerent, but really and truly there's only one way to find out whether they would assault you. And this isn't a place where someone who's not wearing a uniform will come to your aid. So at least the middle-aged woman did test the waters and kind of gave me the green light to show how polite I can be to a chav that I know won't retaliate. Of course, it's not exactly a demonstration of leadership to tread when another has, so I let it slide. The chav promptly got up, followed by her friend, and mumble that she can't be pestered like she's some twelve year old. True. But she can surely be pestered like she's got "pestilence" written across her forehead.</p>
<p>Pros of telling off a chav: they'll think twice before doing it to other passengers in the future because someone is showing them they won't take it. Cons: you can be killed or permanently crippled or your career can be destroyed for killing them and going to prison. Really now, is it worth getting life and having to tell your family that you ended up in prison because someone made you mad? Think about it. Whether the departed was an inbred fuck who would never contribute positively to society doesn't mean much to the court.</p>
<p>So basically I and the rest of the passengers in the carriage chose the right course of action.</p>
