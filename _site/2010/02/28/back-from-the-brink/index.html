    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>So what's been happening in the past few weeks. Let's start with my pet hate subject, public transport. The ticker sign on the front and back on each coach pleads us to keep our mobile phone conversations to a minimum volume. To keep them. To a minimum. Volume. Not to make sure that everyone on the carriage knows who you fancy and that you demand to know why that report won't be in your desk in "10-15 minutes when you're in the office". I could go on my phone such as this:</p>
<p>"Alright mate? Yeah, not bad, not bad. I was just dying to know whether you shagged that bird you were talking to on Saturday. You did, eh! Attaboy! Of course she was gagging for it, that much I get. If it weren't for you, someone else would have filled in the slot. So, to business. How many times did you... MOTHERFUCKING GET OUT OF HERE! You shit me not!? Heheh, good man, mate, good man! Just next time remember to give'er one in my favour. Just to honour our friendship. Cool, man, cool. I'll speak to you soon. Bye."</p>
<p>Well, it does sound funny.</p>
<p>The voice over woman who announces the stations the train calls at sounds the same as the voice over woman who announces the bus stop the bus has been requested a stop for and the woman who happily innstructs us to go to our collection point in Argos. I wonder if these voice-over people ever give interviews, same as the woman who did an interview and does the voice-overs for Athens's Metro.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm sure morning's commuters must hate my guts to death when they hear my recorded voice saying that there is a platform alteration to the train which is due in one minute and that 80 people are waiting for. I'm currently living under 24-hour police protection. I mean I don't have it as bad as Geert Wilders or Ayaan Hirsi Ali but still."<br />
I notice fewer of those posters showing two cartoons saying towards the passenger that they will not eat smelly food or that they'll keep their feat off   vacant seats or whatever. To be completely honest, only after seeing those posters did I pontificate whether eating smelly food on the bus or train is a bad practice. After 14 hours in the office or after a big night out you just have to swing by Burger King, fight off a few chav shits who want to get a bit familiar with you and get a juicy quadruple whopper when your train is 5 minutes out. Apparently it is bad etiquette after all.</p>
<p>Speaking of chav shits, I don't think I've seen a poster with an ibred-looking cartoon saying "I will not shout at other passengers or talk to myself or throw chips around". I suppose that files under the "if you become witness of antisocial behaviour please call this number" notice which is very near the other posters. I suppose what they're going to do is chopper in within a minute of your phone call, storm the coach's doors and fire a couple rounds into the chav's chest. If that preferable option is not feasible they have to have cops or rail enforcement officers at the next station or the one next to it shoud they miss the train.</p>
<p>Those of the "antisocial behaviour" exhibitors who aren't reported or escape arrest wind up in a tourist resort in Greece a few months later. Thankfully, hundreds of miles away from my hometown.</p>
<p>Their capital is the Burger King inside Charing Cross rail station. At least their single brain cell is enough of white matter to dictate to them that they should queue for their burger. It is, however, not enough to instruct them that they must not treat the person in front of or behind them as if they're best mates. If you stay away from council flats, which I presume that you do since you are at least articulate enough to read this text, the Burger King in Charing Cross station -( bit more difficult but not impossible) and, finally, Southeastern Rail trains (for many reasons other than this too) then you're in the clear.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that chav behaviour should be met with punitive force and not seen as a disease that needs to be cured.</p>
