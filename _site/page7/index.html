  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p style="text-align:justify;">One of the complaints we hear from our users is that the software we ship to then should "just work".  They shouldn't anticipate a potential bug every other week and if they do we should be able to respond to it immediately.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This should indeed be the case. The software we make is supposed to "just work". After all, this is what you would expect from the manufacturer of your car, isn't it?. You should be able to trust your car and not be afraid that something will fall off the engine when you do 70 on the motorway. Ok, there needs to be some common sense of your part as in drive at the correct speeds for the gear the car is on and also have it serviced after a certain number of kilometres but other than that you would expect it to just be a black box and give you what you need.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-288" alt="Image" src="/assets/id-100113546.jpg?w=390" /></div>
<p style="font-size:.7em;text-align:center;">Image by anankkml / FreeDigitalPhotos.net</p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">"Could a dev look into the blown engine issue as a matter of urgency and push a fix to production asap please."</p>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, every software has bugs. Every time I see the words "known issues" on the readme of a piece of software I download I think that if I do this and I click that, will the whole thing bomb out? If the dev who wrote this knows this what's he doing right now? Is he working to fix it as we speak or is he thinking "fuck it, I've told my customer base what the fuck will happen when you do this and that so I'll fix it maybe next week"?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"We will not ship shit", said <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/09/06/I-am-Your-New-CTO.html">someone</a>. "No amount of management yelling will ever make us ship shit." That would be nice wouldn't it? We should say no every time we think we can't deliver something in the time frames we're proposed and give honest estimates instead. And always do it right. It doesn't matter if we don't ship all the features</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, we seem to think that bugs are a natural part of the software life cycle. "There will always be bugs" is what I've lost count hearing. I'd like to meet the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">man</span> person who's come up with that directive. What we dislike most about our job isn't the testing. It's the bug fixing. It's the investigating in order to find out why the fuck something isn't working right and whether whoever wrote it was daydreaming of beaches and fit birds at the time.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" alt="" src="/assets/id-10086002.jpg" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.7em;">Image by imagerymajestic / FreeDigitalPhotos.net</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">Not to worry, they'll get the new guy to fix that 500 error they see on every page.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I've concluded that there are three reasons why we ship shit.</p>
<h5 style="text-align:justify;">Software development is a creative process</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We get user stories and requirements from the business. We architect the software and materialize those stories in code. If we need clarification we go back to the business and ask for it. I'd rather not have to do this (see reason No. 2 below) but just get everything at once and the requirements be clear. If the customer changes their mind, I'd like to know about it and get the whole story again without the need to ask for clarification. I will think "wouldn't it be better if they had fucking made up their minds when the requirements first came in" but I won't say a word because the customer is always right and pays for my lifestyle.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-288" alt="Image" src="/assets/sp_wow.jpg" /></div>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">No, this is now behind me. No, really, it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The "problem" comes from this: software development is a creative process. It's an art. I equate myself with the street artist that paints your portrait while you feel your muscles hurt while trying to hold still. Imagine telling the painter this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"We need to get the ears out first. What's your estimate for the ears? Let's prioritize this and then the nose. How hard is it to make that? 5 story points?"</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" alt="" src="/assets/portrait.png" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">There's your portrait mate, now off ye fuck.</p>
<p>No matter how hard we try to stick to requirements and use cases and worse case scenarios, there is always room for misinterpretation. Irrespective of how clear an idea you think your have about how your software needs to work, there are ten ways of doing the same thing. There are differences of opinion and perspective. Due to the novelty of each project there is always some amount of uncertainty with respect to its execution. Most of the time and only while you're down to the code, you will think of a use case or an edge scenario that hadn't come up in the meetings. The product managers won't know the answer to that and not even the client will; they will have to think some shit up and you'll have to wait until said shit comes down the chain. This, I call work disruption, a culprit for introducing bugs as we're juggling with multiple logical aspects in our short term memory while some exec didn't think every possible outcome of how the fucking thing should do its job. And this won't happen only once or twice a week.</p>
<h5>We don't like to push back</h5>
<p>We're tech people, not exactly renowned for our people skills. Some of us are downright socially inept. In the Gaussian distribution of software developers those would sit on one end. On the other end are those with good people skills, usually get sick and tired of coding and ever-changing technologies and eventually  become managers. The rest of us struggle to keep up with ever-changing methodologies and technologies until... well I don't know. I've not seen many old programmers around and I doubt they all become managers.</p>
<p>Well, my point is that when we smell conflict on the horizon we do our best to avoid it like the motherfucking plague. "Can you do this feature in two days", asks your project manager with a look that says "You better say fucking yes to that". No. I can't. If I say it'll take four days it'll take four days. I will explain to my best of my abilities why it could take so long but if the reason is that I'm new to this project or platform or the company or that the existing code base looks like the spaghetti I had last night that caused me to do a shit three times between the morning and the afternoon, I'll keep this to myself. At least this is what we should do. Instead we reluctantly agree and some of us even go as far as to say "I'll try" which is code for "Fuck off, it's four days and if you don't like it, tough shit mate".</p>
<p>We are hired to say "no". It won't make us heroes. Yet, we are the technical authority. The project manager, savvy as he* may be, could be more accurate in an estimate. As in, if he has worked with other devs who know a project better than you, he might call you out on this. "But seriously this should take far less". Should it bollocks. You do the work, you provide the estimate and this is the estimate he should hold you to. If he doesn't like it he can get another dev to do the work and you can work on that exciting greenfield project that never seem to be taking off.</p>
<h5>Some of us don't think this is as important as making cars.</h5>
<p>Cars have to be robust and as a non-car mechanic, non-car maker you just have to bestow trust upon it to get you from A to B without killing you and I don't know about you but I don't remember incidents of deaths by car failure - if the car is new or well-maintained.</p>
<p>When a bug needs to be fixed "urgently", you might think "what's the urgency? Does a person die every minute I spend not fixing this?". Unless you work in the healthcare sector, no one will die if your software has a bug. So the most likely case is that for every minute you haven't pushed a fix to production someone is losing hundreds or thousands of pounds per minute. "Money is different, no one dies". Maybe so. Because like the rest of us you live in a non-capitalist economy and money doesn't move the world. No need to worry yourself sick if lives don't depend on your software but if someone tells you to fix something you fucking fix it.</p>
<p>Then find which monkey coded this piece of shit and make sure he doesn't live to see another day for making you stay late... oh it was you six months ago wasn't it.</p>
<p>So this notion of "fuck it, software will always have bugs", I cannot accept. As professionals we have to always strive to improve software quality. In the private sector there's pressure to get out new features and get them out fast. And we don't like to push back because we are tech people and we like talking to computers more than talking to people. Because computers are deterministic and non-unpredictable. Unless the software they run on has bugs.</p>

      <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.thegrumpygrumbler.com/2013/03/24/online-dating-profiles/" rel="bookmark" title="Online dating profiles" itemprop="url">Online dating profiles</a></h1>
    
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It’s a good thing that online dating has lost the stigma it used to have. You can see really attractive, successful women putting up a profile and see it as just another medium to meet men.</p>
<p>I got back into it recently ‘cos why not; I’m a busy man. I’ve got no hobbies or interests of any kind as I spend all my time outside of work by studying and learning new technologies, so there’s no time to meet girls. Bars don’t impress me, they’re not my scene. Besides, what’s the use of going out to those crowded, sweaty, loud, overpriced places if I don’t get to get laid? I mean, come the fuck on! If I wanted to go out just to enjoy myself and have fun, I could go on a country walk but we have spring for that. Though the last memo I got says spring is postponed this year.</p>
<p>So I was browsing through some profiles today and fell into one that belongs to an admittedly drop dead gorgeous female person. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi boys, I have tried many other dating sites but non of the few people that made it onto a date could make it onto a second date... I don't think I'm choosy at all, I just haven't met my fantasy man yet :) . I do have a very specific type, I like 6ft 2 and over with blonde/light brown hair and blue/green eyes who dresses smart-ish and works in an office and has at least a masters degree... That's really it!!! If that's you or even if that's not you but you know someone for me, please get in touch with me and I will send you the deepest prayers from me to find yourself a hot lady... You would be sent to heaven for having helped a 3 years of single ( and at the edge of desperation) girl and would also help your potentially my type fellow mates who are being or might be pestered by me :) ... It's time I get all tamed down and tied up onto a chair and taught some manners and posessed by a big, giant, macho man, I've been let free in the wild for too long...</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok honesty is a quality that most people appreciate, right? So how many hits would this girl’s profile get? I’m sure it’s got a few, after all many of us men (would you please stop calling us ‘males’, thanks) don’t think twice when we see a pretty face. She wants someone tall, Nordic and to have a flashy job (probably forgotten to add in that he should drive an Aston Martin) which is her prerogative, of course, but somehow I doubt that a man who worked hard to get all that would go for someone that is on the edge of desperation and was “out in the wild for too long” and has rejected guy after guy because they don’t have a Doctorate in something. Well, maybe some such men would take her for the aforementioned reason but then she will become their problem. But really she should have mentioned what she has to offer back other than the fact that she happened to be born with good looks. After all you ladies wouldn’t read twice a man’s profile that said “I’m looking for a blonde with big tits who likes threesomes with other girls and leaves me alone when I want to watch the footy”.</p>
<p>Only if you add “and did I mention that I own one of the three Lamborghini Venenos that will ever be produced?” at the end might you have a chance at it.</p>
<p>Here’s my take on online dating profiles. If the above girl can get away with this Paris Hilton-y narrative, meaning she can get past manual moderation, how well would you do if you tried to sound your worst? If you do get any dates, maybe you have to ask yourself why someone would like to date someone sounding like the below. Remember that this is sales and you’re looking to reach out to potential customers. We’re not suggesting you become dishonest but unless you’re the perfect man with no issues you will have to whitewash your online dating presence a bit. Everyone exaggerates a bit. I’ve got savvy enough about these things to read between the lines. So don’t feel guilty doing this whitewash.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>First take:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Really, do I have to do this shit?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I've tried some other dating sites in the past as well as going to speed dating and lock and key parties but so far the girls I have chatted to are either:</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Stuck up bitches</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Nice but want nothing to do with me</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Nice and fancy me but have fallen off the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Yes, superficial, I know, but so are you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I won't waste my time reading your weird, rambling nonsense in your personal statement. If I like you in your photos, I'll contact you or respond to you. Superficial for sure, but then again who isn't, so don't you get sanctimonious with me. Don't dress scantily; don't show your tramp stamps. Nobody likes a slut unless it's a fling (see below). It will cost me less to get a hooker for the evening. With respect to your likes and dislikes just make sure you hate sports, is all. I like the occasional swim in the pool but I haven't been to it for several months now and there's no chance of going more than once every other week. My other interest includes staying at home and beating the meat or playing Call of Duty. This is an expensive town and I'm knackered to go out after work, also can't be arsed commuting on the weekends. I work 60 hours a week and I can only do my chores on the weekends which doesn’t leave me with much free time. I've also got an old car sitting on my bay most of the week and I only use it to do my weekly grocery shopping but sometimes I like to go for a quiet drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I'm not really actively looking for a relationship. Chicks are mad and don't know what the fuck they want no matter how convincingly they say they do. However, if you're into a non-strings fun evening by all means do drop by. Maybe then I’ll prove to all those twerps that yes, you actually can meet someone sitting at home on your computer all day. Oh, and on your way in can you drop by Tesco's and get me a ten-pack of Stellas and two twenty Marlboro lights. I’ll pay for the pizza. Thanks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Body: Fat</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Smoking: Hell yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Drinking: Hell yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Star sign: What does this have to do with anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Has Children: None. That I know of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Wants Children: No, fuck them kids, it's all about me and you, lovely.</span></p>
<p>Honesty is obviously a good thing but being less honest is different from being dis-honest. Let’s see If we can do better.</p>
<p><strong>Revision 1:</strong><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Well, I don't know what to write here but here goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I've tried some other dating services in the past but nothing quite cut it for me, so I'm making yet another attempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">What I'm looking in you is that obviously you have to be good looking but also have a good personality, like the indoors and the outdoors the same. Looking for someone sweet and less of a "party girl". I'm not a very sporty person but I enjoy my swimming and always make time for it through my busy work schedule. Other interests include going for a quiet drive to the country, I enjoy going out but sometimes I just want to stay at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I don’t know exactly what Ms Right will be like but if it happens, it happens. Let’s meet up and see whether we “click” together or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Body: A little bit overweight</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Smoking: Occasionally</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Drinking: Socially</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Star sign: (your star sign here or just pick one at random)</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Has Children: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Wants Children: Maybe (let’s get her out there now and see how we break the news shortly afterwards).</span></p>
<p>Don’t think that this will land you any (dateable) girls either. It’s reeking with clichés.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, I don't know what to write here but here goes.”</p>
<p>Well, shit, we’re all winging it with this thing, man. We know you can’t be arsed but think about it as a job interview. It’s not going away anytime soon and you have to sit it if you want the goods. Actually remind me that I should write a post about job interviews sometime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I've tried some other dating services in the past but nothing quite cut it for me, so I'm making yet another attempt.”</p>
<p>And when she reads this she’ll think “the bloke just trolls through dating services just in case he gets something, stay away, stay away.” This time you’re not saying why your previous attempts were failures but you’re leaving it to her imagination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What I'm looking in you is that obviously you have to be good looking but also have a good personality, like the indoors and the outdoors the same.”</p>
<p>Ah, the old “I like going out but also staying at home watching a movie” thing. By that you can capture the attention of a sporty or a quiet one. Don’t even try; she knows you’re grasping at straws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t know exactly what Ms Right will be like but if it happens, it happens. Let’s meet up and see whether we “click” together or not.”</p>
<p>None of us knows what the special someone will be like and when we will meet them unless our parents have decided this by arranging or forcing our marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good job whitewashing the whole wanking thing and also that you visit the gym whenever you can be arsed.</p>
<p>About the key-value pairs: You should really keep those sincere. I’ve never seen a girl’s profile that she says she drinks and smokes like fuck, except for the girl at the beginning of our story. Seriously, where have all the smokers and drinkers gone? If you drink four bottles of Jack and ten pints of Fosters every week and you’re looking to cut down or you’re thinking about quitting smoking then maybe you could choose “occasional/socially” on both. I don’t know. As for the children, well, we’ve reached the age at which people are thinking about it. Just be honest. You don’t think you’ll sway her to your direction on something as important as this, do you? Will you waste her time before you finally break out the news? By the way, if she doesn’t want kids and you do, it doesn’t mean there’s something inherently wrong with her. Let her go. And before you do that, pass on my email address to her.</p>
<p><strong>Revision 2</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Hey. I’ve arrived at this site looking to expand my avenues to meet you as life is busy as we are all. I work in IT and though I no longer do long hours, I’ve got to a point where my free time is often sucked into studying and learning new technologies, but this is the path that I’ve chosen in life!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I like driving across the countryside, going to the swimming pool and socialising with my mates. Sometimes I just want to stay in and I do just that. With the reading and practicing material that waits around that’s never actually a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">You should know that I’m very difficult and picky when it comes to dating but once we’ve been out once, maybe we're on the right track.</span></p>
<p>Say whatever you want in the key-value pair section, but be sincere about the children stuff. Nobody reads the other shit anyway.</p>
<p>Ok, that’s enough. I’m not giving out my best stuff here. Or maybe I can’t do any better.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For some time now I've been working in a large office environment. I did some contracting work for another client once so I had had a bit of exposure in such a setting before, but never until now had I really pondered as to how things work in one.</p>
<p>Without further ado...</p>
<p><strong>1. Team work</strong><br />
Bigger companies are more organised than startups, which means that if you are a lower level employee in your department, there is a lot of other yous to spread the work on and leave for home just a bit after but as close to 5 pm as possible. I'd worked at a startup where it was headphones-on for 10 continuous hours, each developer working on a different project. Nowadays the same work is done by an agile team of three or four. There needs to be constant communication between the team members and between the team and the business. We enjoy a pint or two after work but more on this later.</p>
<p><strong>2. No one implements anything fully</strong><br />
I'm sure it happens in every trade but I'll talk about IT. Agile. Scrum. Test-Driven Development. Outside-in Development. Forget what they ask you in job interviews. Have you ever done a sprint retrospective AND a sprint review at the end of each sprint in all of the settings you've practiced Scrum? Do you sprint each time you add features? Do you write no more production code until you have all of the unit test code that will cover it? These techniques/principles are there to help us deliver functionality to the business but some of it is "forgotten" as we program that functionality. You know this. Your interviewer knows this. It's definitely a better way to develop software rather than the old "we've got to get the motherfucking thing out of the door yesterday" management style by people in startups who haven't taken a single management course. I've personally never known of a company that does Outside-in development. Yes, by all means you can do what you want with your home projects which have no delivery date by which your market commitments start. At work, it's different. A bit like the impression you get after three interviews where you think you'll be joining The Mother Of All TDD Practices and on your first days in it's all "we should really automate that build" or "we've finally found some time to retrofit the last two releases with unit and integration tests, would you mind helping Team X with writing some?"</p>
<p><strong>3. The office hot babe</strong><br />
It's the one you wish your wife or girlfriend was hot as. She knows it and acts like it. She shakes more than an earthquake when she walks. There's no way she hasn't got a boyfriend. There's also no way of knowing how the hell he got into her pants through all the competition although you can take a pretty good guess. Most likely she's a receptionist or a PR manager or a special assistant to a very, very senior executive.</p>
<p>Yes, by all means look but avoid prolonged stares. Do you want the whole office to see you staring at her arse? Is it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>4. Office parties: You don't have to go.</strong><br />
In a startup you would attend a shared office party. Non-attendance would mean that a noticeable 10% of the workforce would not show. "Fuck off, I can't be arsed" is not an acceptable reason not to go to that Christmas party. Just see it as paid overtime.</p>
<p>Not so in large companies. You have the option of non-attendance. Simply don't RSVP (or whatever the fuck it's called) when you receive the invitation e-mail. They'll all have better things to do at the party than see if you've come.</p>
<p>First off, the beer is free and after a few you may have a slip of the tongue, if you're getting my drift. Second of all, though you may like everyone in your office, you're already spending at least 40 hours a week with people most of which you wouldn't naturally be friends with. Do you want to see more of these people in your free evenings? Sure have a pint or two with your team if you have to but then go back to your friends. That's how I see it. To each his own I guess. I think I speak for most developers when I say that we didn't get into this line of work because we like people. We prefer the deterministic behaviour of the machines we program and not the hassle of unpredictable interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p><strong>5. Not just you, no one else knows bloody anything</strong><br />
Ok, most of us get the gist of what we've come here to do. As you get to know people who work in more "serious" positions, you get to realize that they're just acting it up and are unsure of what exactly is expected of them. They like you to think they've got a good handle of things but all they're doing is making a quasi-good attempt at hiding that they don't. Unlike in the Old Country, most people here have a BA or BSc in something completely unrelated. Quite often, what you're assessed on day in and day out is demonstrating that you know how to take orders, work hard and suggest departmental strategies. But be careful: do it only up to a point, preferably when your input is allowed and don't rock the boat. If there are situations no one likes to change but drive you up a wall, it's time to dust off that CV. In a job interview you should say that you've practiced Scrum and TDD and have proposed and implemented certain alterations in the way the department delivers functionality, which took productivity to skyrocketing levels, although for all you know you and everyone else have been sitting at your desks typing things into a computer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I spent two hours waiting for my train home. For the past two weeks I've been working 15 hours a day includingast weekend so when I finally managed to escape my office early for once (8.30pm) I thought I could at last put my feet up for an hour and enjoy two cups of tea.</p>
<p>And it would indeed have turned out like that if some nob wasn't hit by a train on the line that my train uses.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the details but I would think it isn't pretty when you get hit by a train so there's probably a lot of mess to clean up. And although passing trains wouldn't have much of a problem to pass through splattered brains i'm imagining this is not the case with scattered bones as those might derail a train and that's why they were "delayed". It's also an accident scene so there must be an ongoing investigation over there. Not that they've labelled it an accident. On the train website it just says that "a person was hit by a train" as if they're describing a bar fight scene.</p>
<p>I guess if it was a suicide they would have said that a "fatality" occurred or something similar. If someone fell into the gap between the train and the platform they would have used the word "injured". I guess, that is. I mean how easy is it to fall into the rail tracks with a thick yellow line that's half a meter away from the gap rim?</p>
<p>So let's assume it's a suicide. In that case I'd like to send a message out to all prospective suicide commiters. Please, pretty please with sugar on top, do kill yourselves during early office hours when there'll be plenty of time to clean up your spilled guts off the tracks before people start to leave their offices. You may have lost your jobs and can't pay your debts but throwing yourselves on the tracks when a train is passing by isn't working well for the rest of us who still have jobs and work 14 hours a day to keep them, now is it? We get home even later, we sleep even less and we are at risk of making mistakes the next day when we go to work tired. If you've read this and still want to commit suicide at/after home-time, then you're a hater and I hope you die. Err... Scrap that. I hope you'll burn in hell if there is afterlife. Which I think there isn't. But that's a topic for another entry.</p>

    <p>I read on a left-on-a-train-seat free paper that "a £200,000-a-year lap dancer sues blah blah blah..."</p>
<p>Nothing says "life isn't fair" more than when someone makes more money in a day just for taking off her clothes than many make in a month working real jobs.</p>
