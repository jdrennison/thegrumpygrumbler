  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A Starfleet commander has come under fire after referring to a sentient android as "it" on Twitter.</p>
<p>Commander (OS) David Anderson tweeted last week: "I had the honour to meet Mr. Data yesterday and it showed me around its place of work".</p>
<p>Data, a sentient android who is believed to be the only one of his kind had met Commander Anderson during a Starfleet visit to the Department of Cybernetics in the University of New Sydney where Mr. Data has been teaching since he resigned from Starfleet after his body was decimated in the battle with human clone Shinzon and his CPU and memory boards were transferred onto an earlier prototype on Stardate 56844.9.</p>
<p>"I'm not offended by Commander Anderson's comment", Mr. Data told the Federal Broadcasting Corporation. "It is a well known fact that I'm physically and mentally superior to you humans. I could rule the Earth if I put my wits to work. It's not like I want to do it but I'm just saying."</p>
<p>"I used to want to become human but I take solace in the fact that I can run as fast as a hovercar and can touch the top of the Big Ben if I jump. Also I can perform complex mathematical operations in milliseconds when a human could take days. So I decided that human won't cut it."</p>
<p>Commander Anderson has been suspended and is being investigated.</p>
<p>Users of the social networking site disagreed or responded in fury to Anderson's tweet.<br />
User Beral tweeted: "Fucking patah I hope u burn in Gre'thor you speciecist cunt".<br />
Another user, Vorin, posted: "Your objectifying a sentient life form is illogical. Have you not learnt anything from your third world war?"<br />
Drone Two of Six, a member of a Borg delegation to Earth wrote: "Non organic life forms can also be assimilated and enrich the collective".<br />
Nausicaan vagabond Ghoshk said "u is insensitive Starfleet"</p>
<p>A Starfleet spokesman commented: "All sentient and intelligent life forms, person-made or not, are treated equally under Federation law. Starfleet is investigating Commander Anderson for his remarks."</p>
<p>"Although we don't want to fuck with twitterers who are calling for his head, we'll only behead him if he is found guilty of speciesism".</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I've not written in a while and it's probably going to be just as much time before my next post. But on Saturday I read something in a left-over copy of the Times and I thought I should contribute my two penneth. The article's title went something like this: People lose thousands of pounds in pension because they don't compare annuity providers. I'd like to help whoever has written the piece and whoever was interviewed in the process understand why we prefer to do better things with our time.</p>
<p>The article goes on to explain that customers don't do it because they're afraid they will become confused by the sheer  number of options they are given.</p>
<p>Er... no shit?</p>
<p>I generally consider myself to be a smart man with logical skills. It could take me a few hours or days if I'm not familiar with a market to compare prices but I always find what's best for me in the end. When it comes to pension plans? Not so much.</p>
<p>First off, like most people I didn't know what a pension plan is until I saw it mentioned on graduate job adverts and even that was a bit obscure: they just said that a pension plan is provided. Having become a bit savvy from the old country I suspected what turned out to be true in the end: state pension isn't good to buy a pack of chewing gums so someone thought: "awright, there's a gap in the market that is beckoning me to fill it" and there was the first pension plan.<br />
If you were given a graduate job offer and it didn't include a pension plan you probably went "fuck it, the work looks interesting and I need the money to pay off my student loan". It's too early in your life to think about retirement.</p>
<p>Then you come across a company that does offer a pension plan. You don't get to choose which insurance company to go with, your prospective employer has already signed a deal with one.</p>
<p>You accept the offer and you find yourself saving money for retirement before they get taxed, also your employer contributes. You can choose where you want to invest your money online.</p>
<p>Hang on. Why are you asking me to invest my money? I thought I'm just saving for retirement. "But if the money remains uninvested it won't keep up with inflation and its buying power will be less". In theory you could have £30000 in the bank and in 30 years time it could be worth £2000. Well wouldn't that be about a shit?</p>
<p>Alright I should invest my savings then. What are my options?</p>
<p>Well, you've got several. Property, equities, they all are high risk/high reward or a low risk/low reward. So you could lose money in the hopes of making more money for your retirement or earn enough money for your last years and leave some for your children too. There's never a low risk/high reward investment. You leave all of your hard earned cash in the hands of complete strangers which will either make it go away forever or give you back pretty much what you've put in or give you back a lot more than what you've put in. So the chance of you getting significantly more money than your investment is 1/3. Yes I know that nothing is guaranteed and its all about how much you are willing to bet. My point exactly. It's a gamble. Almost like a gamble that you are dragged into as the alternative is to live on the state peanuts.</p>
<p>The low risk/low reward of any given insurance company has a long unintelligible name.</p>
<p>Mind you we're not on the annuity provider comparison yet, we're still shuffling through shit given to us by one provider. Imagine trying to calculate the amount of annuities you want when comparing annuity providers.</p>
<p>The article mentions something about information overload. When you end up signing up with someone they send you shit-tons of "information packs" which has been called an "anti-consumer practice". There's no pleasing some people. Very little information - they're making stuff difficult to find and people give up. A lot of information, they're trying to fucking fry our fucking brains. I don't actually know if there is a group of middle aged people sitting in a room rubbing their hands with glee thinking "ok let's put that footnote in and try to disorient whoever reads this". But, well, have you tried to read one of the bloody things? I have and I wish I had read a book about nuclear physics instead. I would understand more and would find it a lot more useful in my progress in life.</p>
<p>However all is not lost. You can pay an independent financial adviser to make this decision for you. Since they spend at least 40 hours a week doing this and you only spend maybe 20 days in your entire life they may know better. I don't know how many holidays you've got each year but most of us have the national minimum of 20. Each of these days we have to treat as gold. Hell, even 25 days off which some companies do is too little. Every hour we get outside of work and commute is gold. And I want to spend half a day of my precious holidays not visiting financial advisers.</p>
<p>So yes, that we lose money by not giving a fuck about annuity providers is not news. You want to know what else we get confused about? Mobile deals. Internet. Travel insurance. Used cars. Mortgages. This last one is such a shit, I don't find it much different from annuities. I wouldn't know anything about finances and loans to save my life and even expert financiers (is that a word) get it wrong because it's a chaotic non-deterministic system that we didn't trust before the recession, we trust less now.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago there was another article about people not switching their broadband ADSL or Fibre optic provider. Just think about it. You live in London. You work at least 40 hours a week and only have the weekend to do your chores. If you had to spend your precious weekend comparing "deals" every time one of your contracts expired you wouldn't be left enough time to use the services they provide.</p>
<p>Would a Soviet style scononic model be better? Of course not. I lived in a country where for the first decades of my life we only had two state-controlled TV channels. Private phone and TV were unheard of until the early 2000s and households got theit first <strike>broadband</strike> ADSL lines around that time too after the sole state telecommunications provider would push back for 5 years because they weren't making enough money from their existing ISDN lines they had invested on in the previous years.</p>
<p>Then I came to the UK where it's easier to start a business and before you know ot there are tens of every service provider you can imagine. Then, to prevent an all-out war between them, their executives hold meetings behind closed doors agreeing to keep prices similar and split the consumer crowd.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I have a job which I love and I live in a decent accommodation. In the UK. Obviously it's not all peachy but no matter how bad life gets, when I hear experiences of friends, family and complete strangers from the Old Country, I thank fuck I left 10 years ago and never looked back.</p>
<p>Let me provide you with some context before I move further on. I come from a place where, if not most people, then a vocal minority believes that when our ancestors gave birth to civilization all westerners swung from tree to tree holding bananas. Also, these days we would have had a far better standing in the world if they had just left us alone and not meddled in our affairs. Also, for most of the history of the nation people lived through centuries of hardship. A table at lunch or dinner time is full of food dishes is a sign of affluence and when a guest comes to visit they are bombarded with food supply every time the host notices that their plate has been emptied. If the guest gets full and stops eating, the host gets offended.</p>
<p style="font-size:.8em;">"But you've hardly eaten anything. Only ten pieces of meat, a mountain of potatoes, four slices of feta cheese and eight meatballs"</p>
<h4>How do you do it? I could hardly think of myself living abroad.</h4>
<p><strong>What they think they are saying:</strong><br />
It's not for everyone leaving friends and family behind and go live somewhere else. I find no reason to adapt to a new life.</p>
<p><strong>What we hear:</strong><br />
You would be foolish to leave this God blessed land to go live among... those alien people.</p>
<p>Again, context:<br />
Unless the educational system has improved over the years (which I doubt) from an early age we are conditioned that we were once the only source of light in the world and every other human achievement can have its roots traced back to us. Therefore, wherever you go you find a bit of our civilization in everything. By not becoming an expat you save yourself the trouble of relocating and also the pains of living in a different culture.</p>
<p>Traditionally very few people in the Old Country have lived abroad just to experience something different and better themselves. Most would do it only under circumstances of hardship, after all other options they could think of have been exhausted. Hell, even holidays abroad seem a bit much although "cool" European capitals have become hip in the last few years. Why wouldn't we just stay where we are with our own sea and sun and food and enough local restauranteurs, travel agents and hoteliers to screw us over.</p>
<h4>Here, have some more. Eat well here before you go back to the UK and eat crap again.</h4>
<p><strong>What they think they're saying:</strong><br />
I'm trying to help as the food there isn't good and has little nutritional value.</p>
<p><strong>What we hear:</strong><br />
Without my cooking you're going to become sick from malnutrition. Of course you could just move back here. Since you evidently can't take care of yourself.</p>
<p>There's no chance you won't find good food in London, for good money. British food contains lots of meat since this is northern Europe we're talking about and a med-diet wouldn't make sense here.</p>
<h4>Don't you miss your family?</h4>
<p><strong>What they think they're saying:</strong><br />
You have been away so long and they miss you. Money and career is good but family is above all else.</p>
<p><strong>What we hear:</strong><br />
No matter how good a life you've got you have effectively abandoned your mum and dad. It doesn't matter that you're 35. You should stay at home until you're married.</p>
<p>I love my parents and they love me. I just don't have to have them in the same town or country all the time for this love to be demonstrated. Also, your parents won't be with you forever.</p>
<h4>A professional with your talents can find good work here. Government ministries announce new job openings all the time.</h4>
<p>Assuming you fulfill said government ministries' near-impossible hiring standards especially for those who have studied abroad (unless you know some official that can get you in through the 'back-channels'), how do you put up with the rest of living there? I've lived through things here and the UK has become my home. People have given this all up to go live in the Old Counrty again out of a feeling of homesickness and vague promises of "well it's not that bad really, you can get some good work and also there's the sun and the sea and us". Everyone I know who's done this is now either unemployed or getting shit money. Some are trying to get through a government ministry's impossible hiring standards. Hard to get in but being under government employ is a surefire way to leave work at the same time every afternoon and while you're in the office, to lean back and take the taxpayer's money.</p>
<h4>If all expats returned and brought Western expertise with them this country would be a better place.</h4>
<p>Far as I know this country will always be a vast hornet's nest of corrupted politicians and citizens and poor infrastructure and a few good people can't change a thing. Many politicians and scientists there have been educated in the West and what good has this brought us? Precisely none.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Over the years I and many other Londoners have been inconvenienced by tube closures during the weekends, except the summer of 2012 when it also happened that very few of us actually cared to use it.</p>
<p>When commuting to work it sometimes breaks down. When you want to go out and pull someone, they close whole sections.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_344" align="alignnone" width="802"]<img class=" wp-image-344 " title="Tube closures" alt="Planned engineering works for the weekend. Everything will be closed. We thought to rally the troops and fix a bit of everything. Really, why do you want to go out this weekend anyway? People will be fighting everywhere and you may get caught in the middle. Also, we know and you know there's no chance of you getting hooked so there's that too. Whatever, just wait until we're done." src="/assets/tube4.jpg" width="802" height="535" /> It took me more time to find a good tube map photo than think up the punchlines and add them to it.[/caption]</p>
<p>They say the works will take <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18072.aspx">as much as 10 years</a> to complete. It's already been going on for 10 years, so it'll be 20 years when it's all done. With the advancements in engineering and technology the bits they did first will be pretty much old by the time the projected end-of-engineering-works date will arrive. But I guess as long as they're not the "break-down" type of old, everyone will be fine with it.</p>
<p>Realistically, if there's one thing that will give the Tube more than the estimated 30% capacity, that would be cutting wider tunnels and have wider trains running in them. The cost of it is prohibiting and if they were to go ahead with it they'd close parts of the tube for months or years on end. Instead, they're solving the problems of today and 80 years down the road the tube will need yet more "improvement works" and they'll be closing parts of it again until 2120.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18072.aspx#qu1">A very good FAQ section on the TFL website.</a> One of the things that will be different is that there will be air-conditioned trains when it's all done. Still no mention of being able to use a mobile phone. Last time the train came on top I remember I was so elated to get a signal to access the internet, I thought I was going to die if I couldn't read my feeds for another 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Also, no mention of any plans to deal with drunk fucks on Saturdays.</p>
