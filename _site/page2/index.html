  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A couple has barricaded itself in its house in West London until the terrorist threat the country is facing is 'neutralised'.</p>
<p>Bradley Stone, 45, and Christine Marr, 42, have nailed wooden boards on all of the house's doors and windows and have bought unperishable food to last for three months, according to their estimate.</p>
<p>"The terror alert has been elevated to 'amber', they're not telling us what we're supposed to do about it, so we're just afraid. They're not even telling us what we should be afraid of", Stone told the Bed With Two Wrong Sides Broadcaster on the phone from inside the barricaded property.</p>
<p>"Seriously, they have to give us something", added Christina Marr. "Who knows how many people have gone to fight in Iraq and Syria or how many have returned. All we know is that the government has revved up the threat advisory. So we've done the only sensible thing to do. Now no one is coming in or going out of here."</p>
<p>The barricaded door frames have been sealed with sellotape to prevent gases going into the house "in case of a chemical attack".</p>
<p>The couple has quit their jobs and refuse to pay taxes until the government "does its job properly to protect its citizens".</p>
<p>"After a few days in here, we miss going out but we can't give those murderous savages the satisfaction of getting us", Stone continued. "One of the previous things we attempted was to stare hard at brown bearded looking individuals on public transport to let them know we're watching and make them uncomfortable".</p>
<p>"One of them sneezed on the tube once and I reported him to a member staff for suspicion of bioterrorism".</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>South East MEP Sally Hadland described the relationship between Sunisa Suriyamongkol, a UKIP-supporting mobile food seller in Ramsgate, Kent, and her husband Bradley Stone in "offensive" terms.</p>
<p>"I mean, look at their age difference. No fucking way she wants him for love and he's defo had her flown in."</p>
<p>Bradley Stone said it was outrageous, rude and offensive and he and his wife would withdraw their UKIP membership. Ms Hadland has issued an apology.</p>
<p>The MEP said: "Jesus Christ, here we go again. I'm sorry that my comments were overheard and brought to the couple's attention."</p>
<p>"It was poor judgement that I had not chosen a more private location to express my views. My constituents weren't supposed to hear that I think British women are too good for this old, fat balding chap or that his wife had found an easy ticket to escape poverty and a military regime."</p>
<p>She was interviewed by the Bed With Two Wrong Sides Broadcaster and had agreed to be filmed while she met local people and UKIP members in Ramsgate.</p>
<p>She wore a microphone and was aware she was being recorded.</p>
<p>Mr Stone and Mrs Suriyamongkol have met Ms Hadland at UKIP rallies.</p>
<p>Mrs Suriyamongkol said: "I'm from Thailand. I'm married to an Englishman whom I love and now I'm British."</p>
<p>"What should I do to prove I love Bradley? Return the jewellery and the Merc I've got from him?"</p>
<p>Mr Stone said Ms Hadland's comments were "unacceptable".</p>
<p>"I'm deeply in love with Sunisa and we're very happy together. I hear her often giggle on the phone and sometimes she says 'not yet, he's still here but he's going on a business trip next week.'. I guess she wants to have fun with her girlfriends and sometimes she may think I'm in the way."</p>
<p>"I totally respect that."</p>

    <p>Many over the millenia have wondered which the most despicable type of human is. Some say it's a person who's killed their own mother. Others say it's a cannibal. Others, the man who's skinned his newborn baby alive, put the skin in a blender and then used it as a lube to masturbate over the baby's dead body.</p>
<p>No. In our days, none of these acts is as heinous as using a racial term on someone who isn't of your own race.  The Brigade of PC is gonna get up your arse before you can say <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-28840210">"dunno, a ting tong from somewhere"</a> and that's it, you're in the shitter.</p>
<p>I didn't mention racism because I thought racism is when you deny someone a job opportunity or want to deprive someone of some civil liberties based on their race. I thought racism is when you think a race should be enslaved because it's inferior. Is Janice Atkinson racist? I don't know and i certainly I cannot deduct any of the above qualifiers for racism only from her saying that a Thai woman is a "ting tong from somewhere".</p>
<p>So here's a tip to use racial terms without the nuisance that is the PC Brigade getting offended on behalf of others: make sure your private comments on someone's race <em>stay</em> private. That is, if you're not sure your mike is off, don't say fucking anything. Also, you have to trust the person you are conversing with not to say anything to anyone but let's assume they just won't. Just make sure you truly are alone.</p>
<p>And if you do get caught just do what everyone else does: beg for forgiveness whether you mean it or not. Why apologise if you don't mean it, I hear you ask and I will answer right away. If we only said things we meant, civility and civilization would collapse before you could respond "Same floor as you, hotness" to the fit chick that was on the lift you've just entered and asked you which floor you're going to.</p>
<p>So if you do get caught say you're deeply sorry you were overheard while making a private remark and next time you do it you'll make sure no one will hear you other than the intended recipients.</p>

    <p>The week is near the end and as we all know the weekend starts on Friday at 6pm. All week's been quiet in that my PM (Product Manager or Project Manager, pick one) has asked me "how's it going" only once. With only one hour to go, I'm half way through running a deployment script on one of the two boxes where the production code is running.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_724" align="aligncenter" width="408"]<a href="https://thegrumbler.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/fridaydeployment.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-724" src="assets/fridaydeployment.gif" alt="asd" width="408" height="285" /></a> <br />Maybe I'll do it after a few pints at the local near the office.[/caption]</p>
<p>"JD." I hear a voice right above me. I turn around to see the stern face of my PM. "Did you get my email?"</p>
<p>Without answering I look back at the monitor, hover my mouse cursor over Outlook and start sifting through its open email windows seeking the only window that contains the inbox.</p>
<p>The problem with emails is that no tree needs to be cut down to become raw material for a on-screen window with text and images. Also you can send one without having to get off your seat. As a result, hundreds of them fly across the corporate network every day without any thought. Me, I get tens of the buggers daily, many of them being automatic updates from the CI build server or other services we use, many others have me on the CC field and therefore most of the time the email doesn't even remotely concern me. Sometimes I will get an email directly personally to me. My PM had just sent me one at 16:10. It was now 16:11.</p>
<p>"Did I get it? Yes, I did. Did I act on it? No. I didn't even look at it as I'm in the middle of the release we agreed doing today. May I remind you how we communicate urgencies in this company but also in every company. We're all busy with things. If you want me to look at something within a couple of hours or more, you email me. If you want something in the next five to ten minutes you instant-message me. And if it's urgent come find me."</p>
<p>The PM exhales "well, just read the bloody email".</p>
<p>You know, when you're deeply in "The Zone" and someone disrupts your trail of thoughts? Developers have a lot of tiny bits of information in their heads when they're working at a difficult problem. We can't really keep notes about those bits in a notepad because even the very act of keeping notes is a process that requires effort that we're spending thinking things and the slightest distraction would shatter out concentration. We can access those things in our short-term memory more quickly without writing and reading. That's because new things keep piling up in our short-term memory as we're working through a problem yet we can still dance trough them all. Until someone interrupts us. Everyone knows that context switching is an expensive mental process. Everything we've had in our minds so far gets shattered to make room for the new situation at hand. That someone deserves our wrath.</p>
<p>Uncle Bob Martin's interpretation of "The Zone"<a href="%20is not the same as my one"> is not the same as my one</a>. "The Zone" is your friend.</p>
<p>"We know about this", I reply after reading the very long stack trace that the PM emailed me, still staring at my monitor. "I thought it was being looked at by the team that handles that system. You need to speak to that team."</p>
<p>"Oh, ok. I'll ask them then", says the PM and briskly walks off. If there's anything else I can't help you with, come and ask.</p>
<p>First production server done, monitor the logs for a while and if all goes well, move to the second box.</p>
<p>"JD". That was one of the mobile app developers. "I've made a call to the API from the app and I got a 500 Internal Server Error."</p>
<p>When you've pushed, or in this case, are pushing, a new deployment to the production servers and someone reports that something's fucking fucked up in the application that you've released, the first thing that comes to your mind is whether it's something that you've just changed or something that has been there for a while but it so happened that someone's just noticed it. Before we release an application to production, it is now common in most companies that we have automated tests that exercise various paths of the application. If one of them fails, the build is unfit for release and we have to work out what's wrong with the tested code (or the test that failed) before we release. All tests had passed in that instance but the problem is those tests are never exhaustive. The journeys a user can take and the inputs she can enter (see? I'm not sexist. I can throw a few "she" around to keep the Brigade of Political Correctness at bay) are practically infinite and there could be a case that wasn't covered by tests. If your company has a Quality Assurance team they may find it during their exploration testing. Some other times the requirements could miss out some use cases in which case the production software may behave in an undesirable way. This type of behaviour we call an unintended feature. Also, some of the codebase is years old, people leave and join a company all the time and the person or persons who wrote a piece of logic and/or the PM who ordered it may be long gone or on holiday. The rest of us, who don't know that specific logic off the top of our heads will have to dig in and find what it does, so that is man-minutes, and sometimes man-hours, spent there.</p>
<p>In short, anyone who isn't shocked by the art of software development clearly hasn't undestood what it's about. So those who don't understand software development have us do it instead and sometimes when we give them feedback we receive responses such as "but we're already doing this somewhere else in the platform" or "we've got a last-minute change one hour before the deadline but it shouldn't take you long".</p>
<p>And what could unintended features be like? Like bloody anything! Here's a transcript of the conversation between the mobile app developer and me:</p>
<p>"Hey man," I said, "I'll look at it when I get the chance but right now I'm in the middle of a release. Next time you discover a bug, could you discover it when I'm not doing a release?"</p>
<p>"This can't wait, I'm afraid. As soon as the error occurred, the laptop next to me has just become sentient and has produced legs and a gatling gun between them. Also the printer in the corridor has become an aerial hunter-killer drone and started firing missiles on the accounts team".</p>
<p>Moral of the story: a reminder that when native British people answer with "I'm afraid that..." they mean "I don't care a tiny bit about what you want and why, just shut up and do what they're tellin' ya".</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For the lucky of you who don't know, in at least some parts of the Western hemisphere if you want to cancel your insurance/mobile phone/internet you can't just go to their website and do it. You must call a number, navigate through the menu options and thirty minutes later get to the option that includes "...or if you're thinking about leaving us...". There is no waiting time after this, you get through to someone immediately. Then they try to get you to stay with them. If you live in a country where you can cancel your internet or mobile account online or you can call customer service and ask them to cancel your account and they just do it, I'm really jealous.</p>
<p>After hearing <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ryan-block-10/comcastic-service">this phone call</a> between a Comcast former customer and a Comcast retention centre employee, I almost thought "oh, thank Christ I don't live in the U.S. of A" but really it's not different here in Blighty. I was convinced to remain with one of my current telecommunications providers twice when I called them and asked to cancel my subscription when my contract was approaching its end. A few added incentives, advice on how staying with them will help me since my usage is this were cast on me and next thing you know I was signing for a new yearly contract. The other thing they conducted on me was what I call "churn warfare". They just talk and talk and try to negotiate until you think "fuck it, I'll keep the account if that will make him stop".</p>
<p>Those who know me, know that my argument on every topic is "because I fucking want to" or "because I said it is so" but there are circumstances where I actually have to make a case or is preferable to make a case in order not to sound like a <em>complete</em> fuck-shit. One of these cases is this. For all I know the guy I'm speaking to (I guess they don't put women in those retention departments) could be sitting in a 2x2 room in Bangalore having a gun on his head whose holder would fire if the representative failed to keep the customer with the company. Some of them <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/16/5909591/here-s-why-your-comcast-rep-is-yelling-at-you">don't get paid if they fail to keep over 75% of the customers whose calls are directed to them</a>. If I do move to a different provider I'm contributing to the plight of the guy I'm speaking to. The least I can do is get the admittedly good deal he's offering me and with a little extra money on my part he gets to feed his family or pay for a dinner date if he's in the process of starting a family.</p>
<p>So we're in a ridiculous situation where paying for a service we don't need means someone else gets to eat. And although there should not be a correlation between the two, there is, and it affects everyone who is somehow involved with a service provider. Unless you live in a mountain and hunt and gather to eat, you live in the global village and your actions have consequences on you and others no matter how far they are from you.</p>
<p>So, does that mean that you should be held hostage to your cable/fibre/ mobile service provider in order for someone not to resort to begging or stealing to make a living? Of course not. Even if everyone who thought about leaving a service was convinced to remain and you knew about it you are not ultimately responsible for the sales representative's fate. There are plenty of ways to help others ranging from donating to volunteering. You shouldn't feel like a bad person for cancelling an account because if a company does this to its employees it shouldn't have customers anyway.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that I recently switched providers. I was prepared for a long haul conversation where I'd about lose my shit as soon as the guy started his sales pitch. Instead there was a very nice woman who said something like "sorry you're leaving" a couple of times and half-arsedly attempted to sell me some other packages. They do make half-arsed attempts at selling you things if you suspect that you only pretend you want to live in order to have your bill lowered, which wasn't the case with me. Their manager probably barged into the 2x2 room in Bangalore where they're all packed up and told them that someone shamed Comcast's customer retention and that from now on they have to ease up on UK customers or some of us may start posting recorded calls left right and centre.</p>
<p>If that's true I guess I have Ryan Block to thank for my easy defection.</p>
