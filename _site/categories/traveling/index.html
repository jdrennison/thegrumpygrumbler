	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>We've seen what lot of good our past and current leaders have done us. If I get enough page views I intend to cash them in and consequently rule this dirty little planet. I think my manifest can be drawn up by excerpts of previous articles but I'd like to mention some things that are gonna change around 'ere once I'm in charge. 'Cos some people currently in charge are just taking the piss, it seems.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is I've found solutions to all of world's problems and while I was searching for them I still had the time to drop by the pub. I'm presenting a few right here.</p>
<h3>A cap will be imposed on airline tickets</h3>
<p>We do like to fly often here in Blighty. Heathrow is one of the world's best connected airports.</p>
<p>The airlines know this and it looks to me that their sole purpose is to take the piss. Watching the airline fares going up and down is like watching the fucking stock market, for fuck's sake. You monitor price fluctuations for the dates you want to fly on to save a few tens of pounds. If you're flexible with your dates it means it's the airlines' decision when you're going on holiday, not yours.</p>
<p>This won't longer be the case once this measure is brutally enforced. It will now be your decision when you want to go to a place with decent weather. No longer will you have to choose between sacrificing one of your 20 days off a year or an extra £150 to get the privilege of going away for a bank holiday weekend. Of course, there will still be supply and demand or, rather, supply. If a destination isn't popular at this time of the year airlines will be allowed to drop their prices but if becomes popular then can rise the prices again but only up to the price cap. This will be dependent on the destination and reviewed every year.</p>
<p>Because fuck me if I have to plan my trip one year in advance just not to pay £500 just to get crammed in a metal construct and emerge elsewhere just 3 hours later.</p>
<h3>Food shopping from high street sandwich shops will become easier</h3>
<p>In a further move to a bigger government, I will simplify the rigmarole of buying a sandwich. Sandwich chains, you know who you are but like I said before, the last thing I want right now is to see my face on a rag because someone decided to get offended. But really there aren't that many chains who don't just take your money and give you a receipt but decide to brutally interrogate you before you can walk away with your lunch. Now that I'm not the benevolent dictator of Earth, I can print out some T-shirts that will read:</p>
<p>Take away<br /> I don't want anything else<br /> I haven't got a loyalty card and I don't want one<br /> I want the receipt</p>
<p>When I was a child, then a teen and later a young adult, the process of getting a sandwich was a very simple one. You'd take a sandwich to the till, you'd give a bank note, you'd get change and then leave the store. This would happen in a small, independent shop. In more corporate chains, they'd only ask you if you want anything else to which you'd answer "no, thanks" and not "If I wanted 'anything else' don't you think I would have fucking asked for it instead of waiting for you to ask me?" because they only follow corporate policy. The people in the front line of the service sector have got enough shit to deal with without some idiotic wanker being smart. Just smile and say "no, thank you" to everything they ask. I remember I was sitting at a restaurant and the waitress who was serving me was what I think looked like six months pregnant. If you can't imagine yourself being horrible to her because it took her more than 30 seconds to bring you the bill, why would you do it to others?</p>
<p>I know about suggestive selling, I used to serve coffee and confectionery myself back in the day. Your server simply follows the business's imperatives and, mark my words, they are spot-checked.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-688" src="/assets/home-server-icon.png" width="256" height="256" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">And if they're don't ask to sell more things they're taken offline.</p>
<h3>Voluntary sterilizations</h3>
<p>In order to raise the average IQ of humanity I figured I had to reduce the procreation of certain types. My earliest measures will include sterilization clinics around the world. Anyone can drop in and have their tubes tied or whatever the fuck it's called in the case of men.</p>
<p>Clearly you wouldn't expect someone to just drop in and get sterlized, right? Me neither. Consequently I decided to add some incentives to attract different crowds. I could simply force them off their homes but may I reiterate that I want to be a <em>benevolent</em> authority figure, not a tyrant.</p>
<p>So, depending on the target group, gifts will be thrown in to entice it, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ticket to the X-Factor Live finals.</li>
<li>The discographies of Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Cheryl Cole and One Direction at the time of operation.</li>
<li>A set of weights and protein powder.</li>
<li>A bicycle and a fluorescent jerkin that reads "one less car".</li>
<li>A subscription to the local tanning salon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we're saved for good.</p>
<h3>Listening to music over a certain volume on public transport will be outlawed as a felony</h3>
<p>At least those wearing headphones and setting the volume to max are <i>somewhat</i> justified. It could be they've become hard-uh-hearin' after having done this for too long. But the wankers that use a mini speaker have absolutely no excuse and it's not worth getting stabbed in the lung for telling them to turn down the volume. They <em>all</em> look like the stabby type.</p>
<p>This wouldn't have been a problem if there were laws in place for such a thing. The first time someone does this will be let off with a warning. The second time will have their music playing device and knives confiscated.</p>
<h3>Centuries will be numbered by the first two digits of the years they contain</h3>
<p>So 1950 will be in the 19th century and not the 20th century. Honestly, I've never understood why we can't do this very simple thing. Every time I'm mentioning a historical event I must make calculations in my head as if I'm calculating Tokyo time. So, 1950, that's the twentieth... no, obviously, it's the nineteenth... oh fuck it.</p>
<p>Not any more. From now on 2014 will be in the twentieth century. Same goes for the turn of centuries. If you went to school or graduated by the late 90s you probably had had a debate with someone about when the millennium really ends. The rationale went like this: since there is no year 0, year 1 to 10 would be one full decade, so the next decade would start on 1-1-11. The "twentieth" century started on 1-1-1901 and ended on 31-1-2000. The current millenium started on 1-1-2001. I know, it's kind of fucked up. If I had invented the calendar this oversight obviously wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>Upon my takeover, I'll introduce year zero and century zero. When invented, the concept of zero was hailed as one of the major turnpoints in science. We're also doing it in programming.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-688" src="/assets/home-server-icon.png" width="256" height="256" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">This is a legacy platform that will take us a lot of money to replace. And change the habits of a lifetime.</p>
<p>That's my position for my next election campaign. I'm also open to suggestions.</p>

	  </header>
	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>I took advantage of the national holiday that was and headed for the beach.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-557" src="/assets/beach1.jpg" alt="British Beach" width="676" height="492" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">Well, whatever passes for a beach here, that is.</p>
<p>My first order of business was to get to know the town I just found myself in so I took one of the open decked tour buses that seem to be in every city and town in the world. After all, what's a better way to see a new place than have a local tour guide show you around? Then you'll have more time in your hands to have a stroll in the same high street as in your own town, with the same chain coffee shops, the same chain restaurants, the same chain bookstores, when high streets had bookstores. When food replicators like those in Star Trek are made there won't be any coffee shops and restaurants in the high street either. I'm pretty sure that the only thing that would survive are the pubs.</p>
<p>But I digress. Going back to the tour bus, the thing was parked in the town centre and the tour guide was singing something loudly along the lines of "The best way to see the town and the surrounding areas is by our open top tour bus, you'll spend two unforgettable hours on the tour bus"... you get the idea. "I'd like one adult ticket", I tell him. In case he mistook me for a toddler or an elderly man, of course. Then he taps me on the shoulder and says "get on board and we'll come find you, my friend".</p>
<p>He... tapped me on the shoulder and called me "my friend". This is how the people of the countryside differ from those living in London. In London, the longest conversation you would have with a stranger is when you slightly brush them on the tube, say "sorry" without looking at them in the eye and continue on your merry way. Except on a Saturday night that instead of "sorry" the other person <em>will</em> look at you in the eye and say "oi, you got a problem, bruv?".</p>
<p>During the bus tour, the weather went from sunny to cloudy and then overcast and rain. As I got off the bus he, the guide, said "you just know the weather will be bad when there's a bank holiday". The surprise didn't come right away. Firstly, the reminder sank in that on 6 out of 8 public holidays in the year the weather is utter shit. Then there was the suprise. Hang on, what just happened, I thought to myself. He, the guide, a complete stranger to me, was making small talk? He was chatting to me about the weather and that bank holidays like to bring it down on us. I looked at him as though he'd offered to fill my water bottle with some of his piss.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, you have the fewest public holidays in Europe but remember that at least you have public paid holidays. Now you also want clear skies with them? It's all take, take, take with you lot.</p>
<p>- The Man</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me digress once more, because I like to do so. "Bank" holidays. They call them that because banks are closed during that time and therefore do not handle money. If they don't handle money, no other business can work as the bank is the middleperson (P.C. for middleman) in every transaction. So it's the bank's holiday first and everyone else's second, by consequence. If you wanted to know who really runs the place, you didn't have to experience a financial recession to find out. You needn't have seen the media get all worked up about bankers getting bonuses that's twenty times your salary. The name Bank Holiday is indication enough.</p>
<p>So, weather talk. Typically at this time of the year you can't predict the bloody thing. I was wearing a t-shirt, a shirt and a thin denim jacket. Sometimes it was too warm and I had to take off the jacket. The next minute it was too cold. I am normally not bothered by this as I normally look out of the window in the morning to decide what to wear and if the sky is relatively blue I go "fuck it, short sleeve and the leather jacket it is". I can handle the walk to the tube station/bus stop, weather conditions don't affect me when I'm commuting and there's heat or air conditioning in the office. When I go out, only the venue changes. But it's a wholly different story if I'm travelling lightly for a few days in the spring and I'm out and about all the time. Wear a warm jacket and you'll sweat your bollocks off when the sun comes out. Wear a thin denim jacket and your bollocks will freeze when the sun hides behind a cloud layer or when it's overcast. What I've found that works is to get a backpack with clothes that cover each eventuality but you'll have to be carrying with you always since there's a high likelihood you'll need any and all of the packed garments within an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Nightlife</strong></p>
<p>The night is in full swing and on Friday and Saturday some pubs are allowed to trade for longer than during the rest of the week. Great news! So instead of getting kicked out at 11 you're allowed to stay and drink until midnight. If you wwant to carry on drinking you'll have to go to a club.</p>
<p>I've not seen many differences from London, really, apart from the fact that these places must be full of locals every week. You would think you can't afford to get in a brawl as those you were playing "let's punch each other in the bollocks" with the night before you'll see in a restaurant next week when you take out a first date. Just like in London, everything has a bouncer outside because presumably no one can go and enjoy a few beers without getting into a fight with someone. In fact I've seen it so often that I'm now paraphrasing Arthur Clarke's third law:</p>
<p><em>Any sufficiently advanced number of late night drunken incidents is indistinguishable from premeditated attempts to commit violence on behalf of the general populace.</em></p>
<p>So I'm now pretty sure that lots of people before they go out they think "whoa, what a fucking week that was, I just can't wait to go drink six beers and then punch in the teeth the first unlucky sod I cross paths with".</p>
<p>Other sights include long queues to get into a cheap bar and get cheap shots.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-590 " src="/assets/club-queue-e1401923024928.jpg?w=204" alt="Club Queue" width="300" height="441" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">I've queued for far too long to be turned away by you fluorescent jerkin twats. Here's my ID.</p>
<p>I saw lots of girls that would have done everyone a favour if they either stayed at home or inform us where they're going to be spending the night so we won't be going there. And because these days everyone likes to share the innards of their souls on the Internet, I am offering to write an app that aggregates women's status updates about where they're going when they're going out. To be featured in the data aggregation, the woman must have a sufficiently large Kitsch Index, which will be determined by whether she has selfies on her Facebook and Instagram and how much she looks like white trash. Then the data will be displayed on a layered Google Maps map where you can see the trends of the evening.</p>
<p>Seriously. What we see in any given evening cannot be unseen and if our retinas could speak they would beg us "please, no more!" after the repeated rapings they have suffered.</p>
<p><strong>Fancy dress without being out on a hen night.</strong></p>
<p>If I don't see any ribbons around their torso I just assume they're not celebrating their girlfriend entering married life. Instead, I always assume they had thought "girls, what are we doing tomorrow evening? I say we snag some used PVC nurse uniforms from the dustbins outside the Brazzers studio and hit the town!" Nobody finds it sexy or cute. If men are looking at you it's because they're thinking "what attention fucking slappers they are". Seriously, I've never seen anyone busting a move on women wearing fancy dresses at a club.</p>
<p>Moving on. Barefoot fat chick holding her £10 shoes from Missbehaving in her hand. Not sexy. Give it up. Well we're partially responsible for that too. You see, someone like her will always find someone eager to find just another hole to shove his rod through, no matter whether he is in a relationship or not and chances are it won't even be as good. Hugh Grant used to do Liz Hurley and yet elected to mess around with an ugly prostitute. If Hugh Grant did that, imagine the lengths that you'd go to.</p>

	    <p>I'd include clichés like the Harbour and the Peak in this post but I'd rather eat my own spleen.</p>
<h2>Mass Transit Railway</h2>
<p>In Admiralty there is a sign that says "MTR keeps you on schedule". In the two weeks I spent there the Hong Kong Metro trains were frequent and would never break down. The metro would just work. I can rely on it to take me to the airport without having to leave five hours before my flight "to allow for extra time". Imagine a big sign at Oxford Circus station: "The Tube keeps you on schedule". The Daily Mail would be all over it hours later with an article titled "Tube bosses think the Tube runs on time and doesn't have signal failures or train breakdowns or people ending their lives on the tracks or weekend closures".</p>
<p>Ok, the title needs a bit more work.</p>
<h2>Surgical masks</h2>
<p>In the last 11 years Hong Kong had had two major viral outbr... errr hang on, hang on. In what way were the SARS and the bird flu major outbreaks? Because if you remember rightly, serious-looking people in suits would parade on the telly to tell us that we were all going to die. But we didn't.</p>
<p>When I hear about a "major outbreak" or a "pandemic", I expect it to be followed up by reports of villages whose whole population has been eradicated overnight. I expect to hear about medical camps hosting thousands of virus-stricken victims in their death throes. When the SARS and the HxNx viruses were in their heydays did all Hong Kong ports close? Were the bridges to Shenzhen closed off or bombed and everyone trying to cross over shot on sight?</p>
<p><a href="https://thegrumbler.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/640px-rz_walker_2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-502" src="assets/640px-rz_walker_2.png" alt="Infected outbreak" width="500" height="209" /></a></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;">And if the virus took away the higher functions of the human brain and made the victim withstand extreme pain would they incinerate the populated areas with thermite plasma?</p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;">-Photo: <span style="color:#d5d4d4;">Added by </span><a style="color:#c61010;" href="http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/User:Vatsa1708" target="_blank">Vatsa1708</a></p>
<p>And yet there have been government warnings after government warnings and now you see every other person there wear a surgical mask. I'm no expert but I think a surgical mask won't protect you fully as an airborne disease can still enter from the sides but it can reduce the risk of infection. Also you protect others if you're infected. By looking at a train carriage in London every morning I can pick at least ten people who could use a mask. We're no different than Hong Kong in that we can also contract airborne diseases. Always think of surgical masks next time some inconsiderate motherfucking idiot sneezes on you and offers a grovelling apology. What is your "sorry" good for, cunt? Now get the fuck out of my fucking face.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>Dai Pai Dong must be considered the worst of the worst eateries if the government is trying to close them down. Yet the few times I've been to one, the food seemed as fresh as anywhere else. And it's also a good selling point to tourists. In fact, I liked the food everywhere I've eaten there. When i first moved to the UK it took me nearly a year to get used to the food here. Also, the best takeaway in the UK is worse than the worst takeaway in Hong Kong. Have you tried the kebab in London? Imagine the pus from a skin abscess mixed with flu phlegm and snot. Well, the kebab in the UK is a bit worse than that. I'm not blaming the owners of the UK takeaways, they're just doing what they can with the raw materials they can get. Maybe that's why I've not heard anyone from the government say that they want to shut these shops down.</p>
<h2>Living it up</h2>
<p>I know it's partly due to that there's not enough space for so many people. But these people know how to party. I've seen eateries serving food at 1 am. I don't think they just stay open to serve all those who couldn't be seated when said eateries were full at 8 pm. Food is part of the culture. Alcohol, they do not abuse. You won't see the police picking up drunken slobs from the street who've just glassed someone in the face. People just live their lives consuming things and eating a lot of fresh seafood.</p>
<p>And the safety. I saw once a young girl in a dark street in Mong Kok typing things away on her laptop.</p>

	    <h2>Soho and Lan Kwai Fong</h2>
<p>What can one say about these two places. They're magnificent albeit overpriced. I don't say very often that something is "magnificent", I usually do it when I'm on holiday somewhere different and in a good mood.</p>
<p>First of all, you can tell that the quality of the westerners here is so much better than in the West. It makes sense, I guess. If you're prepared to sit in a metal bird for 13 hours to go to an exotic place you're probably learned some hard lessons in life or you've grown up in a sheltered middle-class family with money and you've had a gap year at the back of beyond already and generally have a certain financial reserve to travel the world or be sent abroad on a contract by a big corporation that has hired you over your exemplary communication and problem solving skills. Or some shit. I don't know, it doesn't make sense really. I had heard these are gathering points for westerners and what immediately came to mind was drunkedness, vomiting and glassings. And a strong police presence. Alas, even the drunks could behave themselves there. What has this world come into?</p>
<p>Some bars had "get pissed for less" offers. Also, a bloke would walk around with a tray of syringes with shots in them. I've not seen this in the UK because I suppose there is a law against it. I've never understood this. If there are so many alcohol restrictions in place why not just go all the way and ban it altogether? Or would that be fascist? I understand the bottle is a method of escape for many but they're ruining it for the rest of us who only want to drink a couple of beers and stop there.</p>
<h2>Wan Chai</h2>
<p>Basically, the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">red light district</span> fuck-joints of Hong Kong are congregated here. I knew this before I went there because someone had told me so. There are bars too but many of them act as venues for meetings of a different nature. That I found out by myself. I was minding my own business trying to order a drink from the bar when I felt at least two pairs of Filipino eyes on me. "'Fuck they want" I thought to myself while I was excusing myself towards the beer taps. One of them locks eyes on mine and I smile. She is quite pretty, I wonder if... no, fuck that. This looks too easy, what the fuck is happening here? I grab my drink and turn around to leave then I feel a hand stroking my back. "Hey babe" says the scantily clad woman smiling.</p>
<p>Seriously. I'm all for meeting someone when I'm on holiday but (a) I'm a bit less grumpy when in a holiday mood therefore it would be unfair for her when we're back home and (b) these women are either whores or house cleaners and tourists should watch their backs.</p>
<p>If she's a whore it's quite likely it'll cost you more than you expect. The bar takes commission to allow her to work there. If she doesn't "close", you have wasted her time and yours. In adjacent bars where all the girls are on the clock, one of them comes to chat to you shortly after you walk in and you haven't picked somebody already. If you turn to leave without buying her drinks usually a big guy will block your way out and demand money as the girl has provided you with the service of being a confidante for ten of her minutes. To the people who run these places the business model is quite simple: once you've walked in you're going to part with some of your money whether be it a big or a small chunk in your wallet. I find it rather degrading to pay a girl just to have her talk to me so I've never visited one of those establishments.</p>
<p>If she's a house cleaner she thinks all us whitefolk are loaded. I'm pretty convinced the logic is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tourist has saved up enough to be here and go on a spending spree right now.</li>
<li>The expat was probably sent here on a contract and therefore gets paid the big bucks.</li>
<li>I am working 6 days a week for peanuts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do understand it's not easy for them, breaking their backs 12 hours six days a week and feeding their families back home. Whatever blows their skirts up. I sat on that street drinking for about an hour and a half and the middle-aged white men getting out of that bar with Asian women whom they then put in cabs and then got on them themselves hadn't stopped.</p>
<p>Now, the men who frequent these places. Typically middle aged, many of them fat, a few not fat. Many of them balding, a few, not balding. In fact, I don't understand where the stereotype of the fat, balding middle-aged man who hunts Asian women comes from. Many of those I saw were neither fat not balding. There were all middle aged though. The man of our story is typically in Hong Kong on a 12-month corporate contract with a family back home and could be either of the two types below:</p>
<p><strong>The pissed-off family man.</strong></p>
<p>His wife is bored stiff of him, his teen children hate him. The year in Hong Kong will be an means of escape and to his wife his actions in the SAR are to be treated like a black box. I'm here to put some money on the table and also do you remember that house extension we never had money for? Now we'll be able to have it built. Just don't ask what I'm doing in my free time.</p>
<p><strong>The cheater-by-circumstance</strong></p>
<p>It was a bit harder for him to part with the missus and the kids but it's for the best. Maybe the family can visit in autumn when the weather is not too hot. He wants to discover what Hong Kong has to offer but never thought to do someone other than his wife. Then one evening, an expat coworker or an already existing cheater-by-circumstance he met in Lan Kwai Fong two nights before says to him "want to hit Wan Chai tomorrow? We can get some Asian 'strange' there, man!" He may be madly in love with his wife but he won't see her for a few more months. It only goes to show some things about us. Our girlfriend could be fit as fuck and love us madly but we're just never satisfied and always looking for another hole to shove it through no matter if it's better or worse. Take Hugh Grant for example.</p>
<p>This is what you would expect in Pattaya but surely not in Hong Kong?</p>

<a title="Angry Traveller’s review – Hong Kong Part 3 (final) – The good bits" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/angry-travellers-review-hong-kong-part-3/">Part 3</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong is an amazing place. I spent two weeks there recently and I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>Well, I said it. You thought I was going to whine like a little bitch right from the get-go didn't you? Oh, well here it comes.</p>
<p>"Most people like to spend only a few days there. What did you do in two weeks? Did you not get bored?", I hear you ask. Although I don't have to, let me explain.</p>
<p>First off, I've done the "few days in Hong Kong" type of thing and it left me with a bitter taste in the mouth. I felt I was doing Hong Kong a disservice by just half-arsing it through the most popular tourist attractions in two days and then fucking off. Never again, I said as soon as I took off from Chek Lap Kok. Hong Kong, we will meet again soon.</p>
<p>Second, I did want to go to the mainland very much but you really have to take three weeks off work to really enjoy it. I could have done 4 days in Beijing, 4 days in Shanghai, 4 days in Hong Kong but I'd be pressed for time and I'd love to spend more days to enjoy each.</p>
<p>Third, I'm not "most people", it's my fucking trip and I can do whatever the fuck I want with it.</p>
<p>They say jet lag is worse when you travel eastbound but this theory doesn't hold water. The jet lag is always worse when you return home from your holiday, always. Also, the flight is always longer. So the perceived time that passes when flying back to the UK always seem longer than the perceived time that passes when flying to Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>After a day of orientation where I did absolutely nothing (they say a task length expands to fill in the available time you have to do it) I went to a well-known dim sum restaurant in Kowloon. This is the conversation that transpired between me and the waitress:</p>
<p>-Excuse me, did you just order chicken feet?<br />
-Yeah. You haven't just run out of it have you?<br />
-Are you sure you want chicken feet? Do you know what it is?<br />
-Yes I know what chicken feet is.</p>
<p>So off she takes and a few seconds later she comes back with a bowl with a couple of chicken paws in it as a last chance to back down before I get it on my table, I guess. I simply nodded and insisted to get it.</p>
<p>I thought that to them, "The West" is a big obscure weird place where everyone loathes the idea of eating any animal parts that aren't from the shoulders or the thighs or the back or the chest of said animal.</p>
<blockquote><p>Son, make sure you do your vaccinations when you visit Europe. I've heard those people like to eat pork ribs and spaghetti.</p>
<p>-Chinese dad to his son</p></blockquote>
<p>In some restaurants in Chinatown in London they mark certain dishes in the menu as "not recommended for European taste" and those are the dishes that attract my interest the most. What do you mean "not recommended"? Perhaps they should change the notice to something like "not recommended for British taste". Because if I told the cooks in any of the restaurants there what we sometimes eat in the Old Country, they'd rip up their cooking certificates and get on the first boat back to China. I brought up some examples to a Hong Kong Chinese. Her reaction: ewwwhowcanyoueatthisthisissodisgustingohmygod.</p>
<blockquote><p>After this I can safely claim that the mysteries of the Orient are no mystery to me. Will you let me have you now, cute Hong Kong girl?</p>
<p>-Agent Johnny English to cute Hong Kong girl</p></blockquote>
<h2>Tailor Touts</h2>
<p>This applies in every place there are touts.<br />
If you've been to Tsim Sha Tsui and you look whi... sorry, I mean Western, you know what I'm taking about. Picture yourself in front of the mirror thinking this:</p>
<p>- Hell yeah. Nice suit I got after all. I only stopped by Hong Kong for a couple of nights on my way to Auckland and I already own 20 suits but there was this kind Indian gentleman who kept following me around the block saying things like "Hey, where do you think you're going? Look at me when I'm talking to you! Just stop for a minute to have a look at my catalogue!". That's what persuaded me to buy this £300 suit.</p>
<p>You may have been in this position once or know someone who has?</p>
<p>What do you mean you don't? I don't know, it might have something to do with that it hasn't happened to anyone in the history of man.</p>
<p>No one likes touts. Fucking no one.</p>
<p>I know and respect the fact that these people are only trying to put food on the table but this business model is worth observing. This is the 2010s. There are businesspeople around the world who think that having someone troll tourist spots and grab unsuspecting tourists by the bollocks and drag them into a dungeon with merchandise is just as effective as dishing out flyers (they already print out price lists on thick paper) or listing their businesses on Trip Advisor or doing viral marketing. Or do some shit other than employing touts. Touts should at last get through their thick skulls that if someone is ignoring them or mumbling "no thanks" while not looking at them doesn't mean "I'm ambivalent about buying one of your beautiful, high-quality thread suits but run behind me and say to me 'Hold on just for a second, just to take a look at the suits we can make for you' one more time and I'll be sure to stop and pay you cash in hand for the suit, a pair of shiny leather shoes and a cotton shirt without even asking for a guarantee that the goods will ship to my address because I'm the trusting guy".</p>
<p>There is a female and less-aggresive version of touts in Soho and Lan Kwai Fong. I don't know if there's a similar English saying but in the Old Country we have a saying: "a cunt hair can pull a cargo ship". I want to believe that the post-modern sophisticated expat men who have travelled half the globe to be there do not subscribe to this saying and won't fall for a short skirt standing outside a bar trying to lure men in. For the most part I am right. However, I did not include the Wan Chai district. More on this in Part 2.</p>
<h2>Lantau Island day tour</h2>
<p>I can't quite remember the tour guide's name but she said to just remember it rhymes with 'queen'. "They call me 'The Queen' in these parts", she went on to say in her fake American accent. "In fact I've been likened to Queen Latifah". Well, she wasn't <strong>entirely </strong>talking out of her arsehole. If Queen Latifah had an illegitimate child with Mr. Chow from Hangover this is what it'd look like. Later on when she said there is no such thing as Lantau Peak and there's only one Peak and that is in Hong Kong island, I decided not to correct her in front of the group mostly because I was going to look more of a twat than she would.</p>
<p>Tai O. A picturesque fishing village almost entirely built on stilts. The fishermen there are probably tired of gweilo faces walking around the place but I think a large part of the local revenue is generated by tourism so they generally shut up about it and take our money.</p>
<p>There, just as in the rest of Hong Kong, they sell dried seafood. The tour guide expressed her, let's call it, indignation that some tourists are surprised that Hong Kongers eat smelly food. "Well why do you eat blue cheese", she said. "This may be as strange to us as us eating smelly food is strange to you". Someone had to explain to her that the West is a big place and in lots of parts of it we find blue cheese disgusting. Hell, I don't even know what blue cheese is. It sounds like one of those cheeses that come with a fungus in them and you're supposed to just eat it along with the cheese. She should be aware of all that already before she addresses all of the group as "you". I was going to explain this to her in front of the group but, you guessed it, it was going to make me look more of a twat than her. Alternatively I would chat to her during the "free time" segments of the tour had she not decided to disappear or just ignore us for a fag. Yes, her job is probably boring but she'll probably have to do something else soon. The numbers of tourists that go to these tours are dwindling. These days we have smartphones with applications and we can learn everything we want from travel websites. In the group I was in, there were no more than six people including me. I'm sure that just like me they booked the tour just to get an easy way to cruise around Lantau's hot spots and see as many attractions as possible without waiting and changing many buses, not because this is the best or only way to go to Lantau.</p>
<p>Ngong Ping village. That's not immediately obvious from the tourist brochures but despite its "traditional"-sounding name this is an artificial village with no permanent residents. The "village" is part of the Ngong Ping 360 tourist site which has souvenir shops, restaurants, ice cream kiosks and a Starbucks. The giveaway was the Starbucks. Non-artificial Hong Hong villages don't have Starbucks.</p>
<p>By the way, do you know that smell that comes from the rubbish bins on a street from which a seafood street market has just closed business and left for the day? That's what dried seafood in Hong Kong smells like.</p>

	    <p>Funny how I keep noticing more things that are wrong about air travel every time I visit the airport.</p>
<p>The one good thing about traveling mid-October is that most people don't take holiday. You can get past the check-in and security quickly and the queues at the duty-free are very small. I still haven't got my head around the sports cars that dominate the middle of the departure lounge and taunt me. So, that was the timeline up to getting into the aircraft. The real fun begins next.</p>
<p>I've said time and again that the whole no electronic devices on the aircraft business has no basis whatsoever. Yes, they do let you use them when the plane has completed the take-off phase but do they ever tell you when that take-off phase is complete? Do they fuck. I normally wait until the plane feels level and maybe a couple of people have got off their seats and opened the overhead compartments. That's my cue to turn on my netbook, MP3 player and what have you.</p>
<p>Do you remember back in 2004-2005 when mobile phones with a flight safety mode was a new thing? Airlines didn't mention anything about not using mobile phones "during take-off and landing even if they are set to flight safety mode". I was wondering how the person sitting across the isle from me would react if he saw me playing with my phone which was one of the few models at the time that had had a flight safety mode at all. Nobody had acted cranky, though. You would think that at least those who take their fucking sprogs with them on the plane would make some noise about me cutting short the life of their little shithead kids.</p>
<p>Before take-off they announce that even if you’re a frequent flyer it's recommended that you watch the safety demonstration. Like safety standards have changed at all in the past 2 months since I took my last foreign holiday. The security standards, however, have indeed changed in the past 9 years and we've yet to watch a security demonstration by the cabin crew. I'm especially interested in knowing the most expedient way of wrestling to the floor someone you hear scream "Allahu Akbar".  If he is far, will someone closer to him tackle him? If not, will I have a chance of diving in his direction before he detonates or is that as aspiring as <a href="https://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2009/10/02/pre-plane-crash-behaviour/">fulfilling my objective with a fuck-target moments before a crash</a>?</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>Since when do we feel guilty for taking holiday? Since when? Isn't it our union-given right to have holidays and forget about work? Yet any holiday that is more than two days makes you feel you're not attending to somebody's money making desire. Someone is not making money while you're on a beach, so don't go on the beach.</p>
<p>When you do manage to go away for a while assuming that your colleagues will take care of your affairs anyway they can, you dread that phone call from the office administrator. "Uh yeah, sorry to bother you on your holiday, but Sue is having a problem with 3000 end users who aren't receiving the e-mails with the code to activate their user accounts. Can you find a wi-fi connection in the hotel you're in and fix it ay-sap please?" Which would be, I suppose, fine if the company were mine. But it isn't, hence the lack of motivation. Assuming my company can launch several products on time and rake it in, I won't be receiving another penny, save the expected and well deserved yearly pay-rise. So where is the motive? Yet, off the top of my head I have two counter-motives. One, I have two people that will bollock me if I make a mistake. So counter-motive one is that I don't want to be hassled. Counter-motive number two is the fear of losing my job. But as we all know that will only make one work just hard enough not to get fired. And will get just enough of a pay rise not to quit.</p>
<p>Anyway this was going to be an entry about this weekend. Thursday was the day of departure. At the train station, I asked for a latte with one brown sugar and as the barista was making it, I realised I had had no cash. That wasn't really the problem as everyone accepts cards at this time and age. The lack of display of a card machine kind of troubled me, though, so I asked the barista if they accepted cards and she said no.</p>
<p>"Right… I haven't got cash, you see", I said to her.</p>
<p>"Is that so? I've just made your coffee, so what am I going to do with it now?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about that. I assumed that you have a card machine since pretty much every other coffee shop in the world does these days."  Except in Greece and probably in the third world shitter you're coming from, is what I omitted to tell her.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, we don't. Ok, fine, don't worry about it."</p>
<p>"I'm not worried. I haven't paid for the drink so it's not my problem."</p>
<p>That was mean but I pretty much get like that at 6:30am.</p>
<p>I arrived at Gatwick and went to the check-in desk. You've read this here before; those questions they ask you when you hand in your luggage, yet it never gets old. There is a loud voice inside me urging me to make a joke. I just have to do it some day. "Yes, a bearded Asiatic man gave me a metallic canister with a green LED on. He was also watching my luggage when I went to get a latte from the nearby Costa. He mentioned to me something about fireworks in the sky but I'm assuming there's a festival here somewhere which he's going to attend." The other one I fancy is "My aunt gave me a birthday present for my cousin who lives in London. I haven't seen the inside of it but my aunt is a devout Christian so there's nothing to worry about now, is it". Then I envision the continuation: sixteen men with bulletproof vests and wielded sub machine guns closing in on me, so I leave it.</p>
<p>There were queues in every shop, even in the toilets. I think it was the first time in my life I had to queue to take a shit. As if this were not all, there were no coat hangers in the toilets either so I had to leave my rucksack on the floor. Don't worry though, the toilet room was reasonably big so I left it next to the door.</p>
<p>I'm still tempted to turn on my mobile phone in flight or use my MP3 player during take off and landing. A advanced aircraft with a state-of-the art nav system couldn't possibly be interfered with when you listen to H.E.A.T.'s new CD, eh? No… but who will make the first step and prove this is so?</p>
<p>Upon my return to Gatwick, the pilot said that we mustn't use any electronic devices until the aircrafe comes to a halt and the doors are open, or they would interfere with the aircraft's system. Yeah. The pilot will crash the aircraft into the jet bridge if you're impatient to check your texts.</p>
<p>Thing is, there is no scientific proof that "electronic devices" "interfere" with an aircraft's systems. It's all about reminding us who the fuck wears the pants in the relationship lest some of us forget.</p>

	    <p>I'm out of the country for two weeks for some long awaited holidays. It's a bit sad that we have come to a point that we need time away from work to feel alive again, but this is the state of affairs we're in. You're confined in an office at least 10 hours a day, sometimes you work from home when you get back. You spend the weekend to do washing-up, grocery shopping, cooking, go to the council swimming pool (I don't count physical exercise as leisure) spend an hour going out for drinks and dinner and an hour to go home, do other things that take turns once every month or every other month and this leaves you maybe with 5-6 hours to yourself on Saturday and the same for Sunday. Repeat the above steps until you're 68.</p>
<p>Away from the grind, then, and here I am at the airport. Upon entering the terminal, I exchanged glances with a police officer with a bulletproof vest on, holding what I think is a submachine gun. I was quite surprised that he hadn't had a partner. If gunfire erupts, which I assume the authorities deem possible otherwise this man would be holding a baton, how far is the backup? Anyhow, I will assume that they're know what they're doing.</p>
<p>Past the Easyjet kiosks I walk. Now, I might mention that every time I think Easyjet, I think the geezer who owns it, one Stelios Hatjiioannou. Wikipedia describes him as a "British entrepreneur" but his accent is worse than mine. My dad saw him on a tennis court in Greece once, with his entourage which consisted of a few bodyguards with handguns. I felt I could have done with something like that when I lived in the more dodgy areas of London. But I'm digressing now again, as I always do, so I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>The lady at the kiosk checks your passport and then asks you some "security questions". Now I realize that this is very serious and you're not allowed to make a joke when you reply. There was in fact the case of that Greek male glamour model whose name now escapes me, who, after a series of photo shoots in London, when he was checking in for his return flight he said that he was carrying a bomb on his hand luggage. He had been banned from the country for many years after that trip of his.</p>
<p>Which is a bit bad, really, 'cos there's some good fun you can have at that point. "Did anyone gave you anything to carry in your luggage on their behalf?" "Yep, that dark-skinned bearded man gave me a metallic cylinder which had a 'nuclear hazard' sign on it but it's just a small cylinder so I didn't give it much thought and took it with me." Instead, I try to keep a straight face and go no, no and no to anything they ask me.</p>
<p>Before you enter security, you have to rummage your hand luggage and part with any liquid container that had capacity of 100ml or more. I don't know why they chose that limit instead of, say, 75 or 89. Is it because it's a good-looking round number? I've had a spectacle cleaning spray confiscated before, as well as shampoo when I was only travelling with hand luggage. At that area you can see some humongous plastic bags all containing confiscated cosmetic liquids, shampoos and the like. Items which, as we're told from the airport megaphones, will be later on destroyed. Yet we all suspect what will happen to them a few hours later: Items that until now had been treated as potential bomb ingredients will go next to the vanity mirrors in the houses of the 16-year-olds who confiscated them in the first place, after they have shared the booty.</p>
<p>The next step is the x-rays of your hand luggage and possibly your frisking. Nothing new there. What is, new, however is the additional x-ray scanners that has been installed just at the entrance of the duty-free shopping mall. That is for examining shoes. And so, my friends, you see the merits of multi-fucking-culturalism in Europe. Richard Reid paved the road by attempting to blow up the plane he was on by detonating a "shoe bomb". Then those other bastards  attempted to blow up some other transatlantic flights and they're the reason why we now drink overpriced bottled water in the airport terminal. If in any of my future flights I encounter a dark-skinned man with a big hooked nose inside the aircraft, I wonder if I can muster up enough courage to walk up to him and say "Hola señor, como está?" and if he doesn't answer demand that he is removed from the motherfucking plane immediately.</p>
<p>As you then make your way to the aircraft via the tube that takes you there, you will no doubt see the famous HSBC posters with a series of photos and large one-word captions on them that alternate between the photos on the wall. The message they want to get across is that there is variety in life because people have different points of view. Which is great, but not always. For example, since this all takes place in an airport, will we see a future ad campaign that portrays a man wired with explosives inside a passenger aircraft just moments before he hits the detonator, then another one next to it with a Middle Eastern village being carpet bombed and the words "terrorist" and "liberator" taking turns in the two photos? They say that a man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter so an ad like this would make a lot of sense. For me, in many cases, like this one for instance, there should be only one point of view. Multiple points of view are great but up to a point. I guess where I'm driving at is that if most people were like me I would get out of my house a lot more often.</p>
<p>Inside the aircraft we are told to switch off all electronic devices during takeoff and landing including mobile phones with flight mode on. So you're confined in a space that can barely take in your volume, only sitting upright for three hours will enable you ti fit in there nicely and to add insult to injury you cannot use your phone's mp3 player to pass the time. I still don't believe that a technologically advanced aircraft that can carry 300 people with their baggage up to 35000 feet, equipped with one of the the most complex circuitry  and navigation system man has created can be "confused" and plummet to the ground taking us all to our deaths just because your parents call you to check how you are getting on on the plane. Yeah. Right. Yet you think that you don't really want to find yourself with a court date so you just comply. Now, come to think about it, I wrote a couple of things on this entry that could land me in court. Upon my return to the UK, could I face capital punishment or a large fine or have my reputation destroyed by the media just for saying that we let people in from far away lands into Europe, bringing their disputes here, some of them going as far to realizing their disputes as blowing up aircraft or Tube trains.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the flights to and from Greece have gone quieter. It used to be the case that i always happened to sit next to some first-year Greek student who for some reason thought I like some chit-chat to pass the time. These days seem to be gone and that's good.</p>
<p>Another good thing is that farts don't smell on the plane.</p>
