	    <p>When we hear that someone has taken their own life we wonder who it was and that when all is said and done none of us is long for this world, really.</p>
<p>Sometimes instead of the above, we think "fucking hell, I'll miss dinner now". This is when a suicide takes place on a train track on which thousands of passengers will be travelling at peak time. Someone had the audacity to jump in front of a moving train when the rest of us have had an exhausting day and we only have a couple of hours to eat something, talk to the family and then go to bed.</p>
<p>If you think that we are insensitive for thinking that, clearly you don't live in London. And if you do, you probably haven't been living here for long and/or your job is very easy. The kind robots will be doing soon (This isn't mine. I don't know who said that). Listen how it goes for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a cat. A small, fluffy cute pet that provides you with companionship. You like the sight of it and you like stroking its back while you're watching telly, when it's home and not busy banging other cats or chasing mice.</p>
<p>One day you get back home and in the sofa there are two cats, yours and a friend of his. You discover there is no chip implant on its neck so you can't trace the owner. It's fluffy like yours and you think yours can do with a bit of company and since cats are highly independent and they'll be spending much time in the back garden you decide to keep the new cat.</p>
<p>A few days later you come back home to see the place infested with cats. So many cats in fact that you watch your step to not step on one's tail. There are cats on the telly, the sofa, the kitchen the shower, the bedroom. You find all of your decorative chinas shattered on the floor as well as all of the dishes you had placed on the dish dryer the night before. Your curtains have been ripped up and all of your furniture has scratches. In that case it may cross your mind that cats in numbers may be more of a pestilence than companionship.</p>
<p>That's what happens in big cities. I think there's far, far too many humans living in such a small space and we all know what happens to a product's value when the market is swamped with that product. We're pestilence that's racing to outnumber locusts. You see thousands of people every day on the way to work and on the way back. That's why we don't make eye contact with anyone as we enter the train. We don't acknowledge them. None of these strangers means anything to us and we think this city would be a better place to live with a 30% reduction in population. When we hear about a (corporate speak incoming) "fatality on the tracks" and it was an accident we think that were there fewer people in the platform this poor sod wouldn't have tripped over and fallen into the tracks. If it was a suicide... how would you feel if one of the tens of cats that suddenly infested your house decided to stick its paws into a wall socket and end it all? Would you curl in sorrow and wonder what its name was?</p>
<p>I've written about suicide during rush our <a title="Will I get home" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/will-i-get-home/">before</a> but in the past few weeks on two separate occasions I tried to hit on two girls who recently moved to London from the "North" and couldn't believe how desensitised we Londoners are in the face of human tragedy. I told them exactly what you read in the previous paragraphs, if you bothered to look. Did I get laid? You will never know.</p>

	    <p>A few weeks ago I was in a software developer event and one of the speakers gave a talk about communication and understanding among the software development community. In it, he spoke about rules of conduct and how any remarks that refer to, among other things, physical appearance are not ok. You could make a comment that seems perfectly fine to you but soneone upon hearing it could feel ignored, excluded, marginalised. As an example he told us about back in the day when he was working in a team where someone said something that caused another team member on the "large" side some discomfort. The guy on the "large" side (large as in "fat", not as in "tall") later on kind of withdrew from the social interactions with the rest of the team and in the end he would only talk to them when he absolutely had to.</p>
<p>What happened during that eventful meeting? Did someone approach the fat bloke and called him a "fat fuck" to his face? Did he say something about "fat people"? No. Their team was developing a custom suggestive dictionary software for touch screen devices and someone said that with all the mistakes we make typing with our "fat fingers" this application would take off easily.</p>
<p>That's right. The absurdity of this was made fun of in "The Thin Blue Line", where Rowan Atkinson's character jokingly says "The pot called the kettle African American". Just how are we supposed to know what offends whom these days?</p>
<p>In the post about <a title="Everyone was looking away and no one stepped in to help" href="https://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/why-wouldnt-anyone-help/">Fiona Mountford's tube incident</a> I could be called a sexist and that I'm suggesting that if a woman gets treated like that she might have struck the first blow (I wasn't there, she might have).</p>
<p>In the post about <a title="Starfleet officer: “Data is a thing”. Twitter erupts." href="https://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/starfleet-officer-data-is-a-thing-twitter-erupts/">a Starfleet officer being accused of speciesism on Twitter</a>, I could be called an insensitive white heterosexual middle class man who mocks whoever becomes indignant over any racist, sexist, classist or speciecist thing that happens to go through their Twitter feed.</p>
<p>One time we had some issues with a software that wouldn't do certain things in some languages and therefore caused problems for people who spoke those languages. As I was investigating this, my product manager went "fucking foreign languages... why can't everyone just speak English". I just nodded and said "in any case, there are languages other than English and we have to support them". I didn't say "I can't believe you just said that". I didn't feel  ignored, excluded, marginalised.</p>
<p>I wonder how what reception a talk of mine about communication and respect would have had if it ended like this: "We are a community and we have rules of conduct. Any comments about race, religion, sexual orientation and physical appearance are in breach of these rules. Of course if a person on the large size is offended by expressions such as 'fat chance' it's their fault for being such sensitive pussies and if they haven't got a metabolism problem it will not be seen as a breach of the rules of conduct to ask them to reduct their frequent trips to McDonald's and go do some exercise. We're here to create great software and not pussyfoot around words in case someone decides to feel offended for the day. If I say 'big arse method' should I get down on my knees and apologise to people on the large side who just happened to be within earshot? Fuck that."</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>Let's talk about being a man. A real man, that is. Let's bring up those things that separate the real men from the effeminate ones, the boys and the metrosexuals. Let's praise real men as these are depicted in a Boris Vallejo fantasy painting.</p>
<p>A real man never finishes all of the milk from a bottle in the fridge. He will always leave a tiny bit in the end for use in his morning coffee or tea. The real man will only be using a fraction of the available quantity each time he needs milk for his beverages now matter how little that is and therefore the amount of the milk left will asymptotically be reaching its depletion. Only the use-by date can act as a cut-off date.</p>
<p>A real man never drinks shandy. Seriously, have you seen anyone walk into a bar in a fresh haircut and a nice suit, walk up to the bartender fixing his sleeves and say "hit me with your best Forster's shandy"? If you want to drink shandy ask your girlfriend or one of the females in your group to order it when it's her round. Right? Wrong! It was a trick question. Now get out of my face!</p>
<p>A real man has done a shampoo mohawk in the shower.</p>
<p>A real man doesn't like the word "male". Ladies, use synonyms.</p>
<p>A real man won't look away if a scantily clad woman notices him checking her out. She's having her assets on display. What has the real man got to be embarrassed about? If you're dressed like a slapper you'll be treated like one. You know motherfucking well what I'm talking about. If yoh wear a wide belt you think is a skirt and show cleavage don't then wonder why you can't find a man who likes you for who you are.</p>
<p>A real man always takes a long, hard look at the product of his last bowel movement and exhale in admiration before he reaches for the flush button. It looks like last night's pizza didn't go to waste after all.</p>
<p>A real man only knows the following colours: red, white, blue, green, yellow, brown, black. Ecru, lilac, fuchsia, turquoise and other shit like that simply do not compute.</p>
<p>A real man never takes "selfies". Seriously, that vain fucking shite needs to cunting stop. It was better when they did it when selfies were not yet called selfies but now it's like they're coming out of a fucking cloning tank. They think that men want to be them and women want to be with them. What we really think is "what an attention fuckin' whore".</p>
<p>A real man has attempted to sneak a fart by on a first date. Not always successfully but attempted it he has.</p>
<p>A real man drives manual. I don't want to hear about it. When it comes to driving, it's manual or nothing. At least in the UK the majority of cars are manual so at least there's that. Also, a real man will slip it from three to two just to get off by listening the engine roar.</p>
<p>A real man will sometimes slam an electronic device when it stops working. It doesn't matter if your smartphone is a sensitive electronic device with thousands of ultra-large scale integrated circuits and no moving parts. Just slam it on the side. What have you got to lose? I won't forget how that worked in the case of my tablet. I dropped it on the ground from lower back label and when I turned it on the screen showed gibberish. It would then continue showing gibberish no matter how many times I turned it off and back on. Then I said "fuck it" and let it drop on the floor again. That fixed it. Maybe this snapped a capacitor back into one of the soldered holes it broke off from or something. In any case. If you're a real man you've smacked things that stopped working, from a PC to a smartphone and, if you're my age or older, a CRT monitor or two. These actually did work again when you smacked them.</p>
<p><strong>Are you a real man, were you a real man in the past, or do you know someone affected by being a real man? We'd like to hear your story. Are there any other things that inevitably define real men and you believe are left out? Feel free to add those in the comments section.</strong></p>

	    <p>Twitter can be utter shit yet other times can be a good source of information about what's happening in your city.</p>
<p>I was recently reading the feed of editor Fiona Mountford who claims she got pushed and verbally abused on the tube. </p>
<p>What did everyone else on the carriage did to defend the lady in distress?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Man offers to fight me on platform of next station. I kindly decline offer. All men in carriage resolutely avoid my gaze.</p>
<p>&mdash; Fiona Mountford (@FionaLondonarts) <a href="https://twitter.com/FionaLondonarts/statuses/444221480193499136">March 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>So, once again, a big thank you to all the men in the carriage, who did nothing while I was being threatened. Genuine thanks to kind ladies.</p>
<p>&mdash; Fiona Mountford (@FionaLondonarts) <a href="https://twitter.com/FionaLondonarts/statuses/444226851897376768">March 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Damn those men who let her be abused and did nothing to intervene. If I were there I would be the first to jump up from my seat and say (doing a Jason Statham voice) "the lady said to leave her alone". Seriously, of all the men on the carriage no one stood up for her?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Good+Samaritan+stabbed+in+throat.-a060773708">Oh.</a> <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Good-Samaritan-fatally-shot-as-he-tried-to-stop-1708799.php">Right.</a></p>
<p>Even if you are some spec-ops veteran or a martial arts expert and could take him, we live in a society where if you're not paid handle such incidents, the cops won't take kindly to you getting involved in a potential fight. Be that as it may, even people who are trained to knock out others with bare hands cannot know the outcome of a fight beforehand and could still be sent to hospital. Not defending themselves or a loved one but a complete stranger. Most people (men included) are not trained fighters.</p>
<p>I wouldn't intervene if a stranger was getting beaten because:<br />
1. You could get harmed or killed when you could just not have provoked the assailant. Someone else was the object of their wrath. C'est la vie. The two links above are an example of what could happen.<br />
2. You become the new target giving the original target the opportunity to scarper. Would the original target join back the fight?<br />
3. We live in a society where this can get you arrested if you're not trained and appointed by the state to break up fights. When you are arrested:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to find and pay for a good solicitor</li>
<li>You have to take time off work</li>
<li>You, your friends and family are put through trauma for days, weeks or months.</li>
<li>If you're not trained and manage subdue the assailant you don't know what amount of force could be regarded reasonable by the police and if they think you used excessive force you could be charged.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this not when you've done something wrong but something very right.</p>
<p>At least this is what the media says can happen and just who am I to dispute a story saying "Man held by police for defending his home from burglars".</p>
<p>Would you like to have one or more of these happen to you over an incident involving a total stranger? I wouldn't. As an eye witness I'd give a statement to the police when they arrived on scene but never intervene.</p>
<p>Μany years ago on the train. Two girls sit together, one of them is chatting loudly on the phone. A woman nearby tells her off.</p>
<p>"Aw I didn't realize I'm disturbin' you innit. I talk on the phone and get told off innit. Bloody 'ell no one else's complainin'".</p>
<p>No, she didn't assault the other woman but simply got up and moved further down the train, yet she had taken a risk for challenging the two chavs. If someone is so inconsiderate that talks loudly on the phone on the train, I tend to assume he won't take too kindly to getting told off by a stranger. With all these knife-wielding thugs ridding London you have to assume the worst. After all you're just going to work and you don't want to swing by the hospital on the way there, getting treated for stab wounds. Over two chavs being chavs. Although I'm pretty sure I've picked up a few STDs just by being on the same carriage with them that morning.</p>
<p>I said something to the other woman though: If she was attacked no one would come to her rescue and that's something to think about next time she thinks about doing what everyone else is thinking. She said she would still do the same thing.</p>
<p>And, anyway, all of us who came to live in London later in life and in the first few months tried to help a complete stranger we'd get rejected until we gave up. The proof for this is that I say so. </p>
<p>I've written a few lines of code that illustrates caring for a stranger in a big city:</p>
<p><code>$a = some bad shit that may happen to people while walking on the street.<br />
$x = guy who gets $a<br />
$y = guy who gets paid to take care of people that get $a<br />
$me = !($x || $y)<br />
So $me can fuck off about $me's god-damn business.</code></p>
<p>Just to respond to any allegation of sexism that may arise from the use of the word "guy" in the above source code. I used "guy" instead of "person" because suck my todger, that's why.</p>

	    <p>For some time now I've been working in a large office environment. I did some contracting work for another client once so I had had a bit of exposure in such a setting before, but never until now had I really pondered as to how things work in one.</p>
<p>Without further ado...</p>
<p><strong>1. Team work</strong><br />
Bigger companies are more organised than startups, which means that if you are a lower level employee in your department, there is a lot of other yous to spread the work on and leave for home just a bit after but as close to 5 pm as possible. I'd worked at a startup where it was headphones-on for 10 continuous hours, each developer working on a different project. Nowadays the same work is done by an agile team of three or four. There needs to be constant communication between the team members and between the team and the business. We enjoy a pint or two after work but more on this later.</p>
<p><strong>2. No one implements anything fully</strong><br />
I'm sure it happens in every trade but I'll talk about IT. Agile. Scrum. Test-Driven Development. Outside-in Development. Forget what they ask you in job interviews. Have you ever done a sprint retrospective AND a sprint review at the end of each sprint in all of the settings you've practiced Scrum? Do you sprint each time you add features? Do you write no more production code until you have all of the unit test code that will cover it? These techniques/principles are there to help us deliver functionality to the business but some of it is "forgotten" as we program that functionality. You know this. Your interviewer knows this. It's definitely a better way to develop software rather than the old "we've got to get the motherfucking thing out of the door yesterday" management style by people in startups who haven't taken a single management course. I've personally never known of a company that does Outside-in development. Yes, by all means you can do what you want with your home projects which have no delivery date by which your market commitments start. At work, it's different. A bit like the impression you get after three interviews where you think you'll be joining The Mother Of All TDD Practices and on your first days in it's all "we should really automate that build" or "we've finally found some time to retrofit the last two releases with unit and integration tests, would you mind helping Team X with writing some?"</p>
<p><strong>3. The office hot babe</strong><br />
It's the one you wish your wife or girlfriend was hot as. She knows it and acts like it. She shakes more than an earthquake when she walks. There's no way she hasn't got a boyfriend. There's also no way of knowing how the hell he got into her pants through all the competition although you can take a pretty good guess. Most likely she's a receptionist or a PR manager or a special assistant to a very, very senior executive.</p>
<p>Yes, by all means look but avoid prolonged stares. Do you want the whole office to see you staring at her arse? Is it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>4. Office parties: You don't have to go.</strong><br />
In a startup you would attend a shared office party. Non-attendance would mean that a noticeable 10% of the workforce would not show. "Fuck off, I can't be arsed" is not an acceptable reason not to go to that Christmas party. Just see it as paid overtime.</p>
<p>Not so in large companies. You have the option of non-attendance. Simply don't RSVP (or whatever the fuck it's called) when you receive the invitation e-mail. They'll all have better things to do at the party than see if you've come.</p>
<p>First off, the beer is free and after a few you may have a slip of the tongue, if you're getting my drift. Second of all, though you may like everyone in your office, you're already spending at least 40 hours a week with people most of which you wouldn't naturally be friends with. Do you want to see more of these people in your free evenings? Sure have a pint or two with your team if you have to but then go back to your friends. That's how I see it. To each his own I guess. I think I speak for most developers when I say that we didn't get into this line of work because we like people. We prefer the deterministic behaviour of the machines we program and not the hassle of unpredictable interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p><strong>5. Not just you, no one else knows bloody anything</strong><br />
Ok, most of us get the gist of what we've come here to do. As you get to know people who work in more "serious" positions, you get to realize that they're just acting it up and are unsure of what exactly is expected of them. They like you to think they've got a good handle of things but all they're doing is making a quasi-good attempt at hiding that they don't. Unlike in the Old Country, most people here have a BA or BSc in something completely unrelated. Quite often, what you're assessed on day in and day out is demonstrating that you know how to take orders, work hard and suggest departmental strategies. But be careful: do it only up to a point, preferably when your input is allowed and don't rock the boat. If there are situations no one likes to change but drive you up a wall, it's time to dust off that CV. In a job interview you should say that you've practiced Scrum and TDD and have proposed and implemented certain alterations in the way the department delivers functionality, which took productivity to skyrocketing levels, although for all you know you and everyone else have been sitting at your desks typing things into a computer.</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>There were two chav girls on the train yesterday morning one of them yelling on the phone about the barbeque she went to the night before.</p>
<p>Then a lady in her early fifties told her off.</p>
<p>The chav girl hung up and said "It's only you who is moaning, no one else".</p>
<p>"I'm sure a lot of other people feel that way but are too polite to speak up"</p>
<p>Me, on the other hand, while I agree that a lot of other people, myself included, feel that way, they would much rather stay quiet than risk physical confrontation with someone who could carry a blade for all they know. Granted, it was 8:30 am, the two chavs were not intoxicated and didn't look belligerent, but really and truly there's only one way to find out whether they would assault you. And this isn't a place where someone who's not wearing a uniform will come to your aid. So at least the middle-aged woman did test the waters and kind of gave me the green light to show how polite I can be to a chav that I know won't retaliate. Of course, it's not exactly a demonstration of leadership to tread when another has, so I let it slide. The chav promptly got up, followed by her friend, and mumble that she can't be pestered like she's some twelve year old. True. But she can surely be pestered like she's got "pestilence" written across her forehead.</p>
<p>Pros of telling off a chav: they'll think twice before doing it to other passengers in the future because someone is showing them they won't take it. Cons: you can be killed or permanently crippled or your career can be destroyed for killing them and going to prison. Really now, is it worth getting life and having to tell your family that you ended up in prison because someone made you mad? Think about it. Whether the departed was an inbred fuck who would never contribute positively to society doesn't mean much to the court.</p>
<p>So basically I and the rest of the passengers in the carriage chose the right course of action.</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>So what's been happening in the past few weeks. Let's start with my pet hate subject, public transport. The ticker sign on the front and back on each coach pleads us to keep our mobile phone conversations to a minimum volume. To keep them. To a minimum. Volume. Not to make sure that everyone on the carriage knows who you fancy and that you demand to know why that report won't be in your desk in "10-15 minutes when you're in the office". I could go on my phone such as this:</p>
<p>"Alright mate? Yeah, not bad, not bad. I was just dying to know whether you shagged that bird you were talking to on Saturday. You did, eh! Attaboy! Of course she was gagging for it, that much I get. If it weren't for you, someone else would have filled in the slot. So, to business. How many times did you... MOTHERFUCKING GET OUT OF HERE! You shit me not!? Heheh, good man, mate, good man! Just next time remember to give'er one in my favour. Just to honour our friendship. Cool, man, cool. I'll speak to you soon. Bye."</p>
<p>Well, it does sound funny.</p>
<p>The voice over woman who announces the stations the train calls at sounds the same as the voice over woman who announces the bus stop the bus has been requested a stop for and the woman who happily innstructs us to go to our collection point in Argos. I wonder if these voice-over people ever give interviews, same as the woman who did an interview and does the voice-overs for Athens's Metro.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm sure morning's commuters must hate my guts to death when they hear my recorded voice saying that there is a platform alteration to the train which is due in one minute and that 80 people are waiting for. I'm currently living under 24-hour police protection. I mean I don't have it as bad as Geert Wilders or Ayaan Hirsi Ali but still."<br />
I notice fewer of those posters showing two cartoons saying towards the passenger that they will not eat smelly food or that they'll keep their feat off   vacant seats or whatever. To be completely honest, only after seeing those posters did I pontificate whether eating smelly food on the bus or train is a bad practice. After 14 hours in the office or after a big night out you just have to swing by Burger King, fight off a few chav shits who want to get a bit familiar with you and get a juicy quadruple whopper when your train is 5 minutes out. Apparently it is bad etiquette after all.</p>
<p>Speaking of chav shits, I don't think I've seen a poster with an ibred-looking cartoon saying "I will not shout at other passengers or talk to myself or throw chips around". I suppose that files under the "if you become witness of antisocial behaviour please call this number" notice which is very near the other posters. I suppose what they're going to do is chopper in within a minute of your phone call, storm the coach's doors and fire a couple rounds into the chav's chest. If that preferable option is not feasible they have to have cops or rail enforcement officers at the next station or the one next to it shoud they miss the train.</p>
<p>Those of the "antisocial behaviour" exhibitors who aren't reported or escape arrest wind up in a tourist resort in Greece a few months later. Thankfully, hundreds of miles away from my hometown.</p>
<p>Their capital is the Burger King inside Charing Cross rail station. At least their single brain cell is enough of white matter to dictate to them that they should queue for their burger. It is, however, not enough to instruct them that they must not treat the person in front of or behind them as if they're best mates. If you stay away from council flats, which I presume that you do since you are at least articulate enough to read this text, the Burger King in Charing Cross station -( bit more difficult but not impossible) and, finally, Southeastern Rail trains (for many reasons other than this too) then you're in the clear.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that chav behaviour should be met with punitive force and not seen as a disease that needs to be cured.</p>

	    <p>I am convinced at this point that I've got a magnet hidden in my torso that attracts those good for nothing arseholes in public places. If you've lived in London for a reasonably long time, you must have bumped into many of them. Those who want some change to top up their train fare (c' est la vie. Did you not plan your return beforehand?). Those who want a cigarette (go buy your fucking own). And those who are just being noisy.</p>
<p>They will make noise on the bus and on the train. Everytime I come across one of those I can't help but remind myself that in my country this indecent behaviour is a rare occurrence and we would always make short work of those bastards. Here, I decided that there is certain abuse that I can take without protesting if this means that they won't slit my throat with the switchblade they possibly pack. However, if anyone attempts to spoil my day while I'm out with a bird, that will be the end of their days. Either I'll end up in the hospital with knife wounds and a broken jaw or they will.</p>
<p>In the UK people are generally respectful of a stranger's boundaries except for a loud minority which when on the piss makes up for all the times it minds its own business. I haven't run the numbers but by the looks of it the minority is more than 30% of the general population. And a 75% of that bumps into me at night.</p>
<p>If I ever reach the point of beating up one of these nobodies and get a sentence for it, I wonder if I will feel a sense of pride. "Jailed for ridding the world of a pushy good-for-nothing yob", the Daily Star will read in its front page. I'd much rather not find out. In fact it shouldn't be a punishable crime to use disproportionate force to teach the poor "youth" that he/she must respect a man's personal space if this is the only way to get the message. You've got someone who is 1. drunk and 2. irrespectful towards fellow human beings. Two separate provocations that, when combined, ought in themselves to constitute a defence of justifiable homicide.</p>
<p>In public transport stations and hospitals there are mounted signs that read a variation of "We will always press for the strongest possible penalties against those who attack, threaten or abuse our staff". Perhaps this will deter many subhumans from assaulting or threatening staff, but quite a few won't give a toss. I am proposing a new sign that could be mounted on the trains that serve my home-work-home route:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We will always press for the strongest possible penalties against those who attack, threaten or abuse our staff. Also mind you that the J D Rennison takes this train home in the evenings. Our idea of "the strongest possible penalties" is  the same as his idea of "the most lenient possible penalties". But fear not; he only takes this route twice a day, so there's still a good change you won't come across him."</p></blockquote>
