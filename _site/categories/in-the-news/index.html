  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Expectedly, average rail fares will rise again early January next year, it has emerged.</p>
<p>For the duration of December this year an endless amount of complaining will ensue on all major newspaper's online comment sections.</p>
<p>"What do you mean prices of things go up?", 29-year-old Lisa Daveson exclaimed. "I've bought this nice two bedroom house in Weybridge that'd cost me £100,000 more if I were to get something similar in Wimbledon. The commute is fantastic as it only takes me about 40 minutes to get to Waterloo and from there another 40 minutes to change three tube lines to go to the office during rush hour. It's fantastic!"</p>
<p>30-year-old City worker Nicholas Overs said: "I moved to Tonbridge where I've bought a three bedroom house for the price of a studio flat in Shepherds Bush. If I catch the train to Charing Cross at 7.12, I can be at the office by 9, after taking the Northern and then the Central line. But now I'm wondering if it was all worth it since it'll be all costing me £100 a year more."</p>
<p>"I'm thinking about remortgaging the house and moving back to London. I miss all the history, the nightlife options and the stuck-up plastic slappers I  used to ogle at when I went out".</p>
<p>Telegraph editor David Anderson said: "All we did was to take last year's article on the subject, change the title a bit, replace the figures and ship it. No one notices and the comments below always count in the hundreds."</p>
<p>"We do the same with the house price articles twice a year and there you have it. For all twelve months everyone's kept uptight and on their toes."</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It's easy to get utterly paranoid if you spend too much time on the Internet or if you often read the rags previous commuters have left on a seat on the tube. However, trust you me, you've not seen anything yet. As people get bored with the same scare stories and the race for readership is only going to intensify in the future where instant global communication will become even faster, the headlines and the (unverified) stories will only become more hideous.</p>
<p>Also, it'll help that we're living in unprecedented times where everything is going to fucking hell quickly. Or maybe not but that's the vibe I'm getting from news outlets. Well, in any case, here are news headlines from a possible future.</p>
<h3>The new YouTube sweetheart is taking the world by storm.</h3>
<p>Susan Deacon, 13, has captivated audiences with her song "I'm waiting for the knight in the shining armour". She's about to be signed with a major record label.</p>
<h3>Pop idol makes young people kill themselves.</h3>
<p>Justin Bieber's latest hit "Don't you wish your bird was hot like mine" has had many young adults slit their wrists in desperation having been reminded that they've just been settling for what they can get all along. They know damn well that being a rich celebrity makes a person better than the rest.</p>
<h3>The most expensive train ticket in Britain costs almost £4000.</h3>
<p>The route from St.Ives to Aberdeen has now reached £3,945 although it doesn't seem to bother the Cornish. "Why would we want to go up there to that dark, moody, rainy place anyway", one of them said. "Them Scots are having their comeuppance for trying to secede. A warm weekend on the beach will cost them dearly so they can stay right the fuck where they are if they don't like us".</p>
<h3>Energy bills have risen by 400% in 2 years.</h3>
<p>"Hey, we've got expenses too" a spokesman said. "We said we'll freeze prices until this year and we did. Now we can no longer absorb the increasing costs. I've already said enough, we don't have to explain ourselves to consumers."</p>
<h3>ISIS fighters are here to kill us all</h3>
<p>According to the latest government figures, an unknown number of people have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS and an unknown number returned to the UK before the media picked up on this story and therefore terrified the government into interviewing returnees from the two countries more rigorously. It is now believed that there <em>will</em> be multiple attacks with tactical anti-matter warheads between now and next week. The country's police forces have dispatched cloaked aerial drones to patrol the capital and other major cities and the Army Reserve has been deployed. The Home Office has raised the threat level to full black and Prime Minister David Cameron has urged the public to drop everything they're doing and remain completely still until everyone in the country is assessed and the suspects are found.</p>
<h3>The damage to the economy is 'irreversible'</h3>
<p>28 million unemployed Britons between 18 and 55 have taken to the streets in protest. The Chancellor has announced there won't be any pensions for anyone as the economy has reached a level lower than the Global Depression's in the 1930s. The only skills that are currently on demand in the country are those of a CEO's, a banker's and a high level politician's.</p>
<h3>Your neighbour has Ebola</h3>
<p>The only reason you would speak to her is to ask her if she would mind turning that hip-hop music down a few notches so you chances are you won't ask her. But she is infected with a rare strain of airborne Ebola. By the way if you haven't seen her at her patio in a while, she may be dead and nobody has yet noticed. It has been speculated that that strain of Ebola can survive outside a host for months and when it feeds on a dead person's cell protein it becomes ten times more airborne.</p>
<h3>Could everyone in the world have all of their online data taken HOSTAGE?</h3>
<p>It has emerged that criminals may be intending to conduct cyber attacks in order to steal account information and data from everyone who is Facebook, Twitter, Google, Evernote or Dropbox, and all the major internet banking systems in the world if they haven't done so already.  If this happens, experts have warned that the data could be sold to the highest bidder for ransom.</p>
<p>"They will know how much money you have in your bank accounts", security expert Steve Mills told us, "and they will probably ask you to cash in all of your assets to unmarked bank notes or all your photos snogging your mistress and the guy from the car part shop will be shown at random on Facebook's or YouTube's home pages when these have their security upgraded and then are hacked again by the same individuals."</p>
<p>Another expert, Troy Hunt, said "I've tried to tell everyone but in one ear it goes and out the other".</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A couple has barricaded itself in its house in West London until the terrorist threat the country is facing is 'neutralised'.</p>
<p>Bradley Stone, 45, and Christine Marr, 42, have nailed wooden boards on all of the house's doors and windows and have bought unperishable food to last for three months, according to their estimate.</p>
<p>"The terror alert has been elevated to 'amber', they're not telling us what we're supposed to do about it, so we're just afraid. They're not even telling us what we should be afraid of", Stone told the Bed With Two Wrong Sides Broadcaster on the phone from inside the barricaded property.</p>
<p>"Seriously, they have to give us something", added Christina Marr. "Who knows how many people have gone to fight in Iraq and Syria or how many have returned. All we know is that the government has revved up the threat advisory. So we've done the only sensible thing to do. Now no one is coming in or going out of here."</p>
<p>The barricaded door frames have been sealed with sellotape to prevent gases going into the house "in case of a chemical attack".</p>
<p>The couple has quit their jobs and refuse to pay taxes until the government "does its job properly to protect its citizens".</p>
<p>"After a few days in here, we miss going out but we can't give those murderous savages the satisfaction of getting us", Stone continued. "One of the previous things we attempted was to stare hard at brown bearded looking individuals on public transport to let them know we're watching and make them uncomfortable".</p>
<p>"One of them sneezed on the tube once and I reported him to a member staff for suspicion of bioterrorism".</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>South East MEP Sally Hadland described the relationship between Sunisa Suriyamongkol, a UKIP-supporting mobile food seller in Ramsgate, Kent, and her husband Bradley Stone in "offensive" terms.</p>
<p>"I mean, look at their age difference. No fucking way she wants him for love and he's defo had her flown in."</p>
<p>Bradley Stone said it was outrageous, rude and offensive and he and his wife would withdraw their UKIP membership. Ms Hadland has issued an apology.</p>
<p>The MEP said: "Jesus Christ, here we go again. I'm sorry that my comments were overheard and brought to the couple's attention."</p>
<p>"It was poor judgement that I had not chosen a more private location to express my views. My constituents weren't supposed to hear that I think British women are too good for this old, fat balding chap or that his wife had found an easy ticket to escape poverty and a military regime."</p>
<p>She was interviewed by the Bed With Two Wrong Sides Broadcaster and had agreed to be filmed while she met local people and UKIP members in Ramsgate.</p>
<p>She wore a microphone and was aware she was being recorded.</p>
<p>Mr Stone and Mrs Suriyamongkol have met Ms Hadland at UKIP rallies.</p>
<p>Mrs Suriyamongkol said: "I'm from Thailand. I'm married to an Englishman whom I love and now I'm British."</p>
<p>"What should I do to prove I love Bradley? Return the jewellery and the Merc I've got from him?"</p>
<p>Mr Stone said Ms Hadland's comments were "unacceptable".</p>
<p>"I'm deeply in love with Sunisa and we're very happy together. I hear her often giggle on the phone and sometimes she says 'not yet, he's still here but he's going on a business trip next week.'. I guess she wants to have fun with her girlfriends and sometimes she may think I'm in the way."</p>
<p>"I totally respect that."</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A YouTube commentator who reviews computer and mobile games has found himself at the end of a lawsuit by a video game corporation.</p>
<p>Daniel Hardcastle, commonly known by his alias NerdCubed, posted a YouTube review of a mobile-based puzzle game published by retail giant EA last January where he made remarks on the state of mobile game purchases today.</p>
<p>EA has created a version of game Dungeon Keeper which is free to download and play but requires the user to make purchases within the game in order to unlock certain features which according to Mr. Hardcastle are required to lift some artificially imposed delays during gameplay that hamper user experience.</p>
<p>"The game has received five starts from thousands of people who I'm assuming are all complete and total fuckwits", "If anyone pays for that you're just a fucking idiot" and "I didn't know there are cunts like EA trying to charge that much money for fuck all" seemed to be some of Hardcastle's comments that sparked the legal action.</p>
<p>"This is a smear campaign", said an EA spokesperson. "If our practices were unethical or illegal there would have been arrests of some board members. No one has been arrested. In fact Dungeon Keeper has been received well by mobile users. Not everyone may like the game, of course, but those who don't simply do not download it. For most people it ends there but not for Mr. Hardcastle."</p>
<p>"Also, we have lost 0.6% in earnings since the video was published. We are holding Mr. Hardcastle entirely responsible."</p>
<p>"Then we'll come for Jim Sterling from the Escapist."</p>

<p>Commander (Op-Spec) David Anderson said he should have "thought twice" before posting his tweet.</p>

    <p>A Starfleet commander has come under fire after referring to a sentient android as "it" on Twitter.</p>
<p>Commander (OS) David Anderson tweeted last week: "I had the honour to meet Mr. Data yesterday and it showed me around its place of work".</p>
<p>Data, a sentient android who is believed to be the only one of his kind had met Commander Anderson during a Starfleet visit to the Department of Cybernetics in the University of New Sydney where Mr. Data has been teaching since he resigned from Starfleet after his body was decimated in the battle with human clone Shinzon and his CPU and memory boards were transferred onto an earlier prototype on Stardate 56844.9.</p>
<p>"I'm not offended by Commander Anderson's comment", Mr. Data told the Federal Broadcasting Corporation. "It is a well known fact that I'm physically and mentally superior to you humans. I could rule the Earth if I put my wits to work. It's not like I want to do it but I'm just saying."</p>
<p>"I used to want to become human but I take solace in the fact that I can run as fast as a hovercar and can touch the top of the Big Ben if I jump. Also I can perform complex mathematical operations in milliseconds when a human could take days. So I decided that human won't cut it."</p>
<p>Commander Anderson has been suspended and is being investigated.</p>
<p>Users of the social networking site disagreed or responded in fury to Anderson's tweet.<br />
User Beral tweeted: "Fucking patah I hope u burn in Gre'thor you speciecist cunt".<br />
Another user, Vorin, posted: "Your objectifying a sentient life form is illogical. Have you not learnt anything from your third world war?"<br />
Drone Two of Six, a member of a Borg delegation to Earth wrote: "Non organic life forms can also be assimilated and enrich the collective".<br />
Nausicaan vagabond Ghoshk said "u is insensitive Starfleet"</p>
<p>A Starfleet spokesman commented: "All sentient and intelligent life forms, person-made or not, are treated equally under Federation law. Starfleet is investigating Commander Anderson for his remarks."</p>
<p>"Although we don't want to fuck with twitterers who are calling for his head, we'll only behead him if he is found guilty of speciesism".</p>
