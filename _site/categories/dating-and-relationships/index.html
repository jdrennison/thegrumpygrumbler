	  </header>
	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>I took advantage of the national holiday that was and headed for the beach.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-557" src="/assets/beach1.jpg" alt="British Beach" width="676" height="492" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">Well, whatever passes for a beach here, that is.</p>
<p>My first order of business was to get to know the town I just found myself in so I took one of the open decked tour buses that seem to be in every city and town in the world. After all, what's a better way to see a new place than have a local tour guide show you around? Then you'll have more time in your hands to have a stroll in the same high street as in your own town, with the same chain coffee shops, the same chain restaurants, the same chain bookstores, when high streets had bookstores. When food replicators like those in Star Trek are made there won't be any coffee shops and restaurants in the high street either. I'm pretty sure that the only thing that would survive are the pubs.</p>
<p>But I digress. Going back to the tour bus, the thing was parked in the town centre and the tour guide was singing something loudly along the lines of "The best way to see the town and the surrounding areas is by our open top tour bus, you'll spend two unforgettable hours on the tour bus"... you get the idea. "I'd like one adult ticket", I tell him. In case he mistook me for a toddler or an elderly man, of course. Then he taps me on the shoulder and says "get on board and we'll come find you, my friend".</p>
<p>He... tapped me on the shoulder and called me "my friend". This is how the people of the countryside differ from those living in London. In London, the longest conversation you would have with a stranger is when you slightly brush them on the tube, say "sorry" without looking at them in the eye and continue on your merry way. Except on a Saturday night that instead of "sorry" the other person <em>will</em> look at you in the eye and say "oi, you got a problem, bruv?".</p>
<p>During the bus tour, the weather went from sunny to cloudy and then overcast and rain. As I got off the bus he, the guide, said "you just know the weather will be bad when there's a bank holiday". The surprise didn't come right away. Firstly, the reminder sank in that on 6 out of 8 public holidays in the year the weather is utter shit. Then there was the suprise. Hang on, what just happened, I thought to myself. He, the guide, a complete stranger to me, was making small talk? He was chatting to me about the weather and that bank holidays like to bring it down on us. I looked at him as though he'd offered to fill my water bottle with some of his piss.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, you have the fewest public holidays in Europe but remember that at least you have public paid holidays. Now you also want clear skies with them? It's all take, take, take with you lot.</p>
<p>- The Man</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me digress once more, because I like to do so. "Bank" holidays. They call them that because banks are closed during that time and therefore do not handle money. If they don't handle money, no other business can work as the bank is the middleperson (P.C. for middleman) in every transaction. So it's the bank's holiday first and everyone else's second, by consequence. If you wanted to know who really runs the place, you didn't have to experience a financial recession to find out. You needn't have seen the media get all worked up about bankers getting bonuses that's twenty times your salary. The name Bank Holiday is indication enough.</p>
<p>So, weather talk. Typically at this time of the year you can't predict the bloody thing. I was wearing a t-shirt, a shirt and a thin denim jacket. Sometimes it was too warm and I had to take off the jacket. The next minute it was too cold. I am normally not bothered by this as I normally look out of the window in the morning to decide what to wear and if the sky is relatively blue I go "fuck it, short sleeve and the leather jacket it is". I can handle the walk to the tube station/bus stop, weather conditions don't affect me when I'm commuting and there's heat or air conditioning in the office. When I go out, only the venue changes. But it's a wholly different story if I'm travelling lightly for a few days in the spring and I'm out and about all the time. Wear a warm jacket and you'll sweat your bollocks off when the sun comes out. Wear a thin denim jacket and your bollocks will freeze when the sun hides behind a cloud layer or when it's overcast. What I've found that works is to get a backpack with clothes that cover each eventuality but you'll have to be carrying with you always since there's a high likelihood you'll need any and all of the packed garments within an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Nightlife</strong></p>
<p>The night is in full swing and on Friday and Saturday some pubs are allowed to trade for longer than during the rest of the week. Great news! So instead of getting kicked out at 11 you're allowed to stay and drink until midnight. If you wwant to carry on drinking you'll have to go to a club.</p>
<p>I've not seen many differences from London, really, apart from the fact that these places must be full of locals every week. You would think you can't afford to get in a brawl as those you were playing "let's punch each other in the bollocks" with the night before you'll see in a restaurant next week when you take out a first date. Just like in London, everything has a bouncer outside because presumably no one can go and enjoy a few beers without getting into a fight with someone. In fact I've seen it so often that I'm now paraphrasing Arthur Clarke's third law:</p>
<p><em>Any sufficiently advanced number of late night drunken incidents is indistinguishable from premeditated attempts to commit violence on behalf of the general populace.</em></p>
<p>So I'm now pretty sure that lots of people before they go out they think "whoa, what a fucking week that was, I just can't wait to go drink six beers and then punch in the teeth the first unlucky sod I cross paths with".</p>
<p>Other sights include long queues to get into a cheap bar and get cheap shots.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-590 " src="/assets/club-queue-e1401923024928.jpg?w=204" alt="Club Queue" width="300" height="441" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">I've queued for far too long to be turned away by you fluorescent jerkin twats. Here's my ID.</p>
<p>I saw lots of girls that would have done everyone a favour if they either stayed at home or inform us where they're going to be spending the night so we won't be going there. And because these days everyone likes to share the innards of their souls on the Internet, I am offering to write an app that aggregates women's status updates about where they're going when they're going out. To be featured in the data aggregation, the woman must have a sufficiently large Kitsch Index, which will be determined by whether she has selfies on her Facebook and Instagram and how much she looks like white trash. Then the data will be displayed on a layered Google Maps map where you can see the trends of the evening.</p>
<p>Seriously. What we see in any given evening cannot be unseen and if our retinas could speak they would beg us "please, no more!" after the repeated rapings they have suffered.</p>
<p><strong>Fancy dress without being out on a hen night.</strong></p>
<p>If I don't see any ribbons around their torso I just assume they're not celebrating their girlfriend entering married life. Instead, I always assume they had thought "girls, what are we doing tomorrow evening? I say we snag some used PVC nurse uniforms from the dustbins outside the Brazzers studio and hit the town!" Nobody finds it sexy or cute. If men are looking at you it's because they're thinking "what attention fucking slappers they are". Seriously, I've never seen anyone busting a move on women wearing fancy dresses at a club.</p>
<p>Moving on. Barefoot fat chick holding her £10 shoes from Missbehaving in her hand. Not sexy. Give it up. Well we're partially responsible for that too. You see, someone like her will always find someone eager to find just another hole to shove his rod through, no matter whether he is in a relationship or not and chances are it won't even be as good. Hugh Grant used to do Liz Hurley and yet elected to mess around with an ugly prostitute. If Hugh Grant did that, imagine the lengths that you'd go to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-605" src="/assets/mainssocket.png" alt="Mains Socket" width="255" height="272" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">Tell me you wouldn't smash that.</p>

	  </header>
	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>It’s a good thing that online dating has lost the stigma it used to have. You can see really attractive, successful women putting up a profile and see it as just another medium to meet men.</p>
<p>I got back into it recently ‘cos why not; I’m a busy man. I’ve got no hobbies or interests of any kind as I spend all my time outside of work by studying and learning new technologies, so there’s no time to meet girls. Bars don’t impress me, they’re not my scene. Besides, what’s the use of going out to those crowded, sweaty, loud, overpriced places if I don’t get to get laid? I mean, come the fuck on! If I wanted to go out just to enjoy myself and have fun, I could go on a country walk but we have spring for that. Though the last memo I got says spring is postponed this year.</p>
<p>So I was browsing through some profiles today and fell into one that belongs to an admittedly drop dead gorgeous female person. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi boys, I have tried many other dating sites but non of the few people that made it onto a date could make it onto a second date... I don't think I'm choosy at all, I just haven't met my fantasy man yet :) . I do have a very specific type, I like 6ft 2 and over with blonde/light brown hair and blue/green eyes who dresses smart-ish and works in an office and has at least a masters degree... That's really it!!! If that's you or even if that's not you but you know someone for me, please get in touch with me and I will send you the deepest prayers from me to find yourself a hot lady... You would be sent to heaven for having helped a 3 years of single ( and at the edge of desperation) girl and would also help your potentially my type fellow mates who are being or might be pestered by me :) ... It's time I get all tamed down and tied up onto a chair and taught some manners and posessed by a big, giant, macho man, I've been let free in the wild for too long...</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok honesty is a quality that most people appreciate, right? So how many hits would this girl’s profile get? I’m sure it’s got a few, after all many of us men (would you please stop calling us ‘males’, thanks) don’t think twice when we see a pretty face. She wants someone tall, Nordic and to have a flashy job (probably forgotten to add in that he should drive an Aston Martin) which is her prerogative, of course, but somehow I doubt that a man who worked hard to get all that would go for someone that is on the edge of desperation and was “out in the wild for too long” and has rejected guy after guy because they don’t have a Doctorate in something. Well, maybe some such men would take her for the aforementioned reason but then she will become their problem. But really she should have mentioned what she has to offer back other than the fact that she happened to be born with good looks. After all you ladies wouldn’t read twice a man’s profile that said “I’m looking for a blonde with big tits who likes threesomes with other girls and leaves me alone when I want to watch the footy”.</p>
<p>Only if you add “and did I mention that I own one of the three Lamborghini Venenos that will ever be produced?” at the end might you have a chance at it.</p>
<p>Here’s my take on online dating profiles. If the above girl can get away with this Paris Hilton-y narrative, meaning she can get past manual moderation, how well would you do if you tried to sound your worst? If you do get any dates, maybe you have to ask yourself why someone would like to date someone sounding like the below. Remember that this is sales and you’re looking to reach out to potential customers. We’re not suggesting you become dishonest but unless you’re the perfect man with no issues you will have to whitewash your online dating presence a bit. Everyone exaggerates a bit. I’ve got savvy enough about these things to read between the lines. So don’t feel guilty doing this whitewash.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>First take:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Really, do I have to do this shit?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I've tried some other dating sites in the past as well as going to speed dating and lock and key parties but so far the girls I have chatted to are either:</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Stuck up bitches</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Nice but want nothing to do with me</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Nice and fancy me but have fallen off the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Yes, superficial, I know, but so are you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I won't waste my time reading your weird, rambling nonsense in your personal statement. If I like you in your photos, I'll contact you or respond to you. Superficial for sure, but then again who isn't, so don't you get sanctimonious with me. Don't dress scantily; don't show your tramp stamps. Nobody likes a slut unless it's a fling (see below). It will cost me less to get a hooker for the evening. With respect to your likes and dislikes just make sure you hate sports, is all. I like the occasional swim in the pool but I haven't been to it for several months now and there's no chance of going more than once every other week. My other interest includes staying at home and beating the meat or playing Call of Duty. This is an expensive town and I'm knackered to go out after work, also can't be arsed commuting on the weekends. I work 60 hours a week and I can only do my chores on the weekends which doesn’t leave me with much free time. I've also got an old car sitting on my bay most of the week and I only use it to do my weekly grocery shopping but sometimes I like to go for a quiet drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I'm not really actively looking for a relationship. Chicks are mad and don't know what the fuck they want no matter how convincingly they say they do. However, if you're into a non-strings fun evening by all means do drop by. Maybe then I’ll prove to all those twerps that yes, you actually can meet someone sitting at home on your computer all day. Oh, and on your way in can you drop by Tesco's and get me a ten-pack of Stellas and two twenty Marlboro lights. I’ll pay for the pizza. Thanks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Body: Fat</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Smoking: Hell yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Drinking: Hell yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Star sign: What does this have to do with anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Has Children: None. That I know of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Wants Children: No, fuck them kids, it's all about me and you, lovely.</span></p>
<p>Honesty is obviously a good thing but being less honest is different from being dis-honest. Let’s see If we can do better.</p>
<p><strong>Revision 1:</strong><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Well, I don't know what to write here but here goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I've tried some other dating services in the past but nothing quite cut it for me, so I'm making yet another attempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">What I'm looking in you is that obviously you have to be good looking but also have a good personality, like the indoors and the outdoors the same. Looking for someone sweet and less of a "party girl". I'm not a very sporty person but I enjoy my swimming and always make time for it through my busy work schedule. Other interests include going for a quiet drive to the country, I enjoy going out but sometimes I just want to stay at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I don’t know exactly what Ms Right will be like but if it happens, it happens. Let’s meet up and see whether we “click” together or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Body: A little bit overweight</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Smoking: Occasionally</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Drinking: Socially</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Star sign: (your star sign here or just pick one at random)</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Has Children: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Wants Children: Maybe (let’s get her out there now and see how we break the news shortly afterwards).</span></p>
<p>Don’t think that this will land you any (dateable) girls either. It’s reeking with clichés.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, I don't know what to write here but here goes.”</p>
<p>Well, shit, we’re all winging it with this thing, man. We know you can’t be arsed but think about it as a job interview. It’s not going away anytime soon and you have to sit it if you want the goods. Actually remind me that I should write a post about job interviews sometime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I've tried some other dating services in the past but nothing quite cut it for me, so I'm making yet another attempt.”</p>
<p>And when she reads this she’ll think “the bloke just trolls through dating services just in case he gets something, stay away, stay away.” This time you’re not saying why your previous attempts were failures but you’re leaving it to her imagination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What I'm looking in you is that obviously you have to be good looking but also have a good personality, like the indoors and the outdoors the same.”</p>
<p>Ah, the old “I like going out but also staying at home watching a movie” thing. By that you can capture the attention of a sporty or a quiet one. Don’t even try; she knows you’re grasping at straws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t know exactly what Ms Right will be like but if it happens, it happens. Let’s meet up and see whether we “click” together or not.”</p>
<p>None of us knows what the special someone will be like and when we will meet them unless our parents have decided this by arranging or forcing our marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good job whitewashing the whole wanking thing and also that you visit the gym whenever you can be arsed.</p>
<p>About the key-value pairs: You should really keep those sincere. I’ve never seen a girl’s profile that she says she drinks and smokes like fuck, except for the girl at the beginning of our story. Seriously, where have all the smokers and drinkers gone? If you drink four bottles of Jack and ten pints of Fosters every week and you’re looking to cut down or you’re thinking about quitting smoking then maybe you could choose “occasional/socially” on both. I don’t know. As for the children, well, we’ve reached the age at which people are thinking about it. Just be honest. You don’t think you’ll sway her to your direction on something as important as this, do you? Will you waste her time before you finally break out the news? By the way, if she doesn’t want kids and you do, it doesn’t mean there’s something inherently wrong with her. Let her go. And before you do that, pass on my email address to her.</p>
<p><strong>Revision 2</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Hey. I’ve arrived at this site looking to expand my avenues to meet you as life is busy as we are all. I work in IT and though I no longer do long hours, I’ve got to a point where my free time is often sucked into studying and learning new technologies, but this is the path that I’ve chosen in life!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I like driving across the countryside, going to the swimming pool and socialising with my mates. Sometimes I just want to stay in and I do just that. With the reading and practicing material that waits around that’s never actually a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">You should know that I’m very difficult and picky when it comes to dating but once we’ve been out once, maybe we're on the right track.</span></p>
<p>Say whatever you want in the key-value pair section, but be sincere about the children stuff. Nobody reads the other shit anyway.</p>
<p>Ok, that’s enough. I’m not giving out my best stuff here. Or maybe I can’t do any better.</p>

	    <p>I haven't written anything for a while, not because I haven't found things to be grumpy about (in fact, as my bed has two wrong sides, I can always find things to be grumpy about), but indeed because there are so many I don't know where to start. That, combined with 11 hour work days makes me think I need to do something more constructive with my ever limiting free time. Even more constructive than log anything preposterous I see in order to see nodding heads, that is. However, today this is the most constructive thing I figured I can do for the day.</p>
<p>If you're my age or older you're either married or most of your friends are  married with or without children or in a serious relationship. I don't know how you feel about that. Me, I'm totally indifferent. I couldn't care less.</p>
<p>There is the perception that all men, and I mean ALL men, are sharks who want to get a fling before they settle down with the woman of their life. Maybe that's true, but some of us prefer to spend our time in hobbies we know and tried instead of in women. I think of myself as someone who lives a fulfilling life without having to search for that special someone. Although I do want to settle with the right woman in the distant future I'm resisting all social pressure to pursue a fling. Because this is what it's all about.</p>
<p>I want to be able to live in a world where nobody thinks that there must be a reason why you're single while 30+. I want to live in a world where when you tell a fellow bloke of your last night out, he doesn't jump in to ask you "nice one geezer, did you pull any birds?", but rather if the musicwas good or if the drinks weren't spiked or how the guy who tried to take my turn at Burger King reacted when I said to him that his mom left her flip-flops at my house.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I'm merely enjoying myself during the limited spare time I've got per week and if the right woman comes along, so much the better. If not, c' est la vie. Casual flings, they're not for me, unless they involve older women with whom I know I can't have a relationship.</p>
<p>I guess I'm something a prospective girlfriend would call a "commitment phobic". That's right. Whoever doesn't want to get married or to have a woman to tell you what time she expects you home, or do this and that or you're pretty much happy with your life when you just flirt about, is stuck with the clinical condition of "commitment-o-phobia". Mind you I've also met women who suffer from "commitment-o-phobia". I don't know if they get the attention of women who don't suffer from it, perhaps not so much as we "commitment-phobic" men draw most oftheir fire.  I don't know if you can get something from over-the-counter to mitigate the symptoms and even if there is, it's most likely placebo.</p>
<p>Normally I don't make a song and dance about the merits of my single life but whoever asks, learns.  This time I made an exception as a fellow bachelor may find his way to this blog and read this and nod in agreement.</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>I went to a private party yesterday. In a nutshell, what this thing is, is a singles’ event that takes place in a fancy lounge bar and all the men walk around wearing a key around the necks and all the women wear padlocks and they all have name tags on. The key (couldn’t resist the pun) is to match the lock with the correct key but in essence it’s all about getting singles to meet. To cut the long story short, it’s your typical night in a bar, only in this one you look like a member of staff in a gig venue.</p>
<p>I’m generally not good at dating, I will admit. I’ve been to one of those before, met that woman, went on three dates with her before we stopped seeing each other. Before that, there was that speed dating thing two years before where I had a vibe with that Russian woman but I was so pissed up that I thought i may say something I shouldn’t.</p>
<p>I booked the ticket about two months ago in order to be benefited by their ‘early bird saver’. A fat lot of good it did me.  What seems a good idea two months ago seems nothing but an inconvenience today as a lot of things could potentially change over the course of two months. For one, you could have met someone but let’s not go there now. At the end of the day I thought ’sod it let’s go’ and went. I only bothered to turn up 2 hours after the opening time.</p>
<p>Compared to the other lock and key parties I’ve been – ‘cos I generally enjoy going to them – there was something different about this one. Could it be that there was disproportionality between men and women (with the men being more) or maybe even something about the people themselves. When I got there everyone had already made new friends or flirting and such. Makes you curse for not having brought in a “wingman” with you. Not that I haven’t tried that but apparently my mates have better things to do.</p>
<p>I’ve discovered that we men make a hard sell of ourselves when in bars. There is a limited time frame, you’ve got to make split second decisions before the taller, more handsome bloke goes for the bird you’re eyeing. The hard work falls on you, my man. Women, on the other hand, have it easy. All they have to do is just show up and if they are the least decent looking they’ll have numerous single horny guys flock to them.</p>
<p>In the end I knew well where this was going. No woman would want to be with a “lone wolf” someone who is continuously scanning the area to find a woman who isn’t talking to a man in order to move in for the kill. I pretty much ended up in a line of poor sods standing in a corner, working out their probabilities.</p>
<p>That sort of social pressure I have felt upon me since time immemorial. The message is, you can’t just bloody go to a bar or club and leave at 3am empty-handed. That just doesn’t work that way. This is what we were taught by movies, magazines and what have you.</p>
<p>I think the part of initiating conversation with a woman in a bar should be excised. In an ideal world you would just approach a girl and say “hi lovely, fancy a bonk?” and it would always work. Everything else is bollocks. She knows you’re attempting to pick her up, so that would save you, and her, the time. Besides what’s to talk about beyond “how are you finding it so far”, profession and the like? I find conversations with blokes far more interesting but the problem is I only like women.</p>
<p>Time spent on the venue: one hour, ten minutes.</p>
