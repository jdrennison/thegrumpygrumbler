	    <p>For the lucky of you who don't know, in at least some parts of the Western hemisphere if you want to cancel your insurance/mobile phone/internet you can't just go to their website and do it. You must call a number, navigate through the menu options and thirty minutes later get to the option that includes "...or if you're thinking about leaving us...". There is no waiting time after this, you get through to someone immediately. Then they try to get you to stay with them. If you live in a country where you can cancel your internet or mobile account online or you can call customer service and ask them to cancel your account and they just do it, I'm really jealous.</p>
<p>After hearing <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ryan-block-10/comcastic-service">this phone call</a> between a Comcast former customer and a Comcast retention centre employee, I almost thought "oh, thank Christ I don't live in the U.S. of A" but really it's not different here in Blighty. I was convinced to remain with one of my current telecommunications providers twice when I called them and asked to cancel my subscription when my contract was approaching its end. A few added incentives, advice on how staying with them will help me since my usage is this were cast on me and next thing you know I was signing for a new yearly contract. The other thing they conducted on me was what I call "churn warfare". They just talk and talk and try to negotiate until you think "fuck it, I'll keep the account if that will make him stop".</p>
<p>Those who know me, know that my argument on every topic is "because I fucking want to" or "because I said it is so" but there are circumstances where I actually have to make a case or is preferable to make a case in order not to sound like a <em>complete</em> fuck-shit. One of these cases is this. For all I know the guy I'm speaking to (I guess they don't put women in those retention departments) could be sitting in a 2x2 room in Bangalore having a gun on his head whose holder would fire if the representative failed to keep the customer with the company. Some of them <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/16/5909591/here-s-why-your-comcast-rep-is-yelling-at-you">don't get paid if they fail to keep over 75% of the customers whose calls are directed to them</a>. If I do move to a different provider I'm contributing to the plight of the guy I'm speaking to. The least I can do is get the admittedly good deal he's offering me and with a little extra money on my part he gets to feed his family or pay for a dinner date if he's in the process of starting a family.</p>
<p>So we're in a ridiculous situation where paying for a service we don't need means someone else gets to eat. And although there should not be a correlation between the two, there is, and it affects everyone who is somehow involved with a service provider. Unless you live in a mountain and hunt and gather to eat, you live in the global village and your actions have consequences on you and others no matter how far they are from you.</p>
<p>So, does that mean that you should be held hostage to your cable/fibre/ mobile service provider in order for someone not to resort to begging or stealing to make a living? Of course not. Even if everyone who thought about leaving a service was convinced to remain and you knew about it you are not ultimately responsible for the sales representative's fate. There are plenty of ways to help others ranging from donating to volunteering. You shouldn't feel like a bad person for cancelling an account because if a company does this to its employees it shouldn't have customers anyway.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that I recently switched providers. I was prepared for a long haul conversation where I'd about lose my shit as soon as the guy started his sales pitch. Instead there was a very nice woman who said something like "sorry you're leaving" a couple of times and half-arsedly attempted to sell me some other packages. They do make half-arsed attempts at selling you things if you suspect that you only pretend you want to live in order to have your bill lowered, which wasn't the case with me. Their manager probably barged into the 2x2 room in Bangalore where they're all packed up and told them that someone shamed Comcast's customer retention and that from now on they have to ease up on UK customers or some of us may start posting recorded calls left right and centre.</p>
<p>If that's true I guess I have Ryan Block to thank for my easy defection.</p>

	    <p>Technology has penetrated every aspect of our lives. Just to take the internet as a sole example, in the twenty years that we've had it as we know it, life has changed radically.</p>
<p>So at this time and age surely you'd think someone would have built something that just bloody works? 'Cos most of the things I've seen or used don't.</p>
<p>WordPress editor - extra lines appearing intermittently out of nowhere and you can only remove them if you go to plain text view and press backspace or delete over whitespace.<br />
Smartphone - it's got ridiculously slow over the past few months and I had to disable most apps that came with the phone without me asking for them just to give it some extra speed. I also had to manually clear the cache of every working app as the internal RAM was still in critical mass.<br />
Camera - Battery only lasts a couple of outings. Maybe an outing and a half if I make heavier use of it. Also the battery icon only has three indications: Full, One Bar Down and Blinking Red: About To Shut Off.</p>
<p>In fact the only things I've seen have worked consistently as per factory specs for the years I've had them are my mini vacuum cleaner and my stubble trimmer.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-649 size-full" src="/assets/trimmer.jpg" alt="Trimmer" width="212" height="128" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">There's actually a set of larger blades that comes with it. I use it to shave my bollocks.</p>
<p>So nice work, us! It only took us fifty fucking years to make a vacuum cleaner and a razor blade work as they should.</p>
<p>In the 50s they told our parents that by 2000 we'll be commuting to work via jet capsules that will be travelling inside tubes that will be sprawling across the city. I remember this envisioned future being told to us by teachers and media In the 80s even, although the "by" year was shifted a bit forward. To this day we've not seen super-tall buildings, spiralling carriageways that go up in the sky and robot taxi drivers.</p>
<p>Yeah, what happened to those, I wonder? You'd think robots would be capable enough these days to ask you your destination, drive you somewhere and then ask for the fare or get out of the car and chase you at superhuman speed should you attempt a runner.</p>
<p>Robots do become more complicated but they're not yet ready for a real end-user application. This is how the history of robotics can be summed up, as this was demonstrated in various university research facilities around the world:<br />
1980: Robot walks on flat surface and avoids obstacles.<br />
1990: Robot walks on a flat surface and avoids obstacles but it's made up of more complicated parts.<br />
2000: Robot walks on a flat surface and avoids obstacles but it's made up of even more complicated parts.<br />
2010: Robot that looks incredibly like a Japanese woman if you watch a video of it in 144p, walks like the robots of the past three decades, raises its hands like a robot of the past three decades and blinks.</p>
<p>The same goes for the web. The internet's scope hasn't changed in the last 15 years, said scope being to search for information, shop and have a wank, but today it's done with large beasts that are programmed in two or more languages. Websites tend to behave as an interactive desktop application. Instead of keeping the same stateless HTTP that drives the whole web and dance around it with cookies and hidden HTML fields and what have you, why can't we upgrade the protocol to allow duplex connection and phase out the existing HTTP? As if this were not all, some companies are treating some web standards as guidelines only and that leaves us poor sods having to code around their non-compliance to those standards.</p>
<p>Recently, Google held a "keynote" presenting its new products. From an end user's perspective they're just the same as the old products only a bit fancier with fancier animations and they're planning to put Android into more things, including wristwatches that can read notifications from your phone. Because, really, that's what was missing from the world. Google finally responded to the deluge of user feedback desperately asking to have a wristwatch that can show a fraction of what an Android phone does, at the price of three watches that can't do that.</p>
<p>What do you mean they had not had such feedback?</p>
<p>Most people who own an expensive smartphone use it in the same manner as they used to use an expensive smartphone before it was called a smartphone: call people, send texts and plan your day with the built-in calendar and task list. Only now they can do it on a 24-month contract. Would any of them go back to a Sony Ericsson K-800? No. Someone told us these old phones are no longer cool and trendy and you need those new touch screen ones with the faster processor and the better animations. I want to show my new S-fucking-5 to my peers, the K-800i is so 2008. And this is in fact where technology has gone wrong. It's become a fashionable thing and has been left to the marketing cocks of business outfits to decide what new gadget we get to see next but if there's one thing for sure it's that at the very least they shove the successor of last year's model down our throats every year. Unless you have £500 to spend on a new fucking "smart"-phone every year you'll probably be replacing it less often but since marketing cocks have convinced you that they seem like they're ten-a-penny, if you drop it and it breaks you'll probably think "well, it's been 13 months, time for a new one anyway. Also a 2014 phone looks more like a 2014 phone as opposed to the 2013 model I bought last year." Silly? Well, evidently it works.</p>
<p>The same goes for us on the producing side of technology. You learn a new way to create a web application that just Creates/Reads/Updates/Deletes records from a database. When you've got a good grasp of it, bam, it's different. Not only did it work before they changed it, it also worked well. Now it's working well but it may have more bugs in it. As far as the end user is concerned unless there's new functionality in an application or significant visual changes they couldn't give a rat's left bollock how it works under the bonnet.</p>
<p>Before you shove all kinds of useless bells and whistles into something, make sure whatever's already there works. Before you put a 12MP camera into the latest phone, it'd help if you kept the 8MP cameras they have right where they are but fix them so they can take non-grainy photos even if we're not pointing them directly at the sun. Compact cameras; same thing. Give us better image quality without noise. I don't know anyone who uses the smile detection feature. Also, the ISO 3200 mode in most, if not all, compact cameras produce photos which are shit but hey let's include an ISO6400 one! But then again the sales department would have a hard time to sell a non-inclusion of new bells and whistles.</p>
<blockquote><p>" We don't have enough time to fix things <em>and</em> add new things before our cut-off release deadline date so in our new flagship model coming out this year we thought we should have existing functionality work better instead of adding anything new. Well, surely the processor is new but we don't make them ourselves anyway. If you have our previous model you surely have noticed that if you take photos in any lighting conditions other than an exploding nuclear bomb you're hard-pressed to tell what those grains in the photo are supposed to make up. So now the camera will produce good photos in sunny and overcast days too and we didn't add extra megapixels. Also we increased the battery life so your new phone can go for over 12 hours without recharging by sticking in a bigger battery and making the phone the size of a brick."</p>
<p>- Advert on new features</p></blockquote>
<p>This loop we've fallen into is perfectly summed up in a cartoon I saw somewhere a few weeks ago where a guy plays a new racing game in his console and his girlfriend says "This looks like like the game you were playing last year" and the boyfriend goes "no that one was Drive Fast 4. This is Drive fast 5." The girlfriend then says something like "so you're racing other cars in Drive Fast 5 just like you did in Drive Fast 4. What's the difference?" and the boyfriend goes "but can't you see the pixel shading in this new one?"</p>
<p>This is a vicious cycle in which our standards are low and corporations don't bother releasing anything above them. Because they don't make anything radical, we become accustomed to and take what they give us without giving much thought to what greatness could be invented.</p>
<p>But no one ever listens to me so you just get what's coming to you really.</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>I phoned up BT to talk about my broadband connection which was never activated. That wasn't the first time I called them for the same reason. The first time I tried they promised they'll let their order management department know about my siuation and someone will ring me on my mobile. Never happened. The second time, I got redirected to every conceivable BT department with many waiting intervals in between. 43 minutes after I dialed their number, my phone's battery died out and I had to leave for work. Which brings us to today.</p>
<p> I spent about 35 minutes hearing that they are sorry, but they "are very busy at the moment" and that my call will be answered "as soon as possible". At least they were decent enough to drop the "your call is important to us" bullshit. Because, clearly, if my call were important to them, they would have hired more staff to keep the call queue shorter. I considered the ringback option for a moment (if the call queue is too long, you can select the ringback option and they say they'll call you back within a hour), but I remembered two occassions a few years ago when I did so and no one deigned to ring me back. So I decided to wait.</p>
<p> So, 35 minutes on, a rather peeved third worlder said something that I didn't clearly understand, not least because I had the phone on speaker and was caught a bit off guard partly because of it, and partly because I thought the sales department was based in the UK.  After much deliberation and many intermissions folllowed by "thank you for staying on the line" - like I have much of a choice - he said that a manager would call me on my mobile within 48 hours. Thinking that the previous case was an one-off, I agreed but I decided to take a shot and ask him what exactly the problem with my line was.</p>
<p> "It's fairly technical and even if I could spend an hour explaining it to you, you still wouldn't understand," the third worlder snaps.</p>
<p> I'll tell you why I didn't snap back "Mate, I work in IT and telecoms so you can take  a shot if you like". First off, you do want to be on the good book of a bunch of third worlders who know where you live. Second, imagine being confined in a chair with space as much as that of an economy class airplane seat somewhere in Bangalore and have a middle class twat half a planet away shouting abuse at you. Third, I believe that most of these people genuinely want to help but they are allowed/have the capability to do only so much.</p>
<p> That happened a week ago and no one called me back.</p>
<p> I dreaded going with TalkTalk or Tiscali or whatever the bloody hell it's called these days, Bulldog, if it hasn't yet gone bust or any of the other small providers as I would trust all of them combined just as I would trust a cat next to my hamster uncaged. With BT I still had a chance since I've been with them three times and have never had problems with them. Granted, their broadband speed is fucking slow but unless I was willing to pay Sky's exorbitant "one-off set up fees" and a TV package I don't need, BT was the next best thing. In fact, there was an article in the paper last December titled "UK broadband slower than Greece". You just know that things are utterly fucked when you hear something like that. Every time I visit family I am surprised by the fast speed a video stream is buffered from the web. The fastest broadband I've had here was with Sky and you can still tell the difference.</p>
<p> "Which are your favourite TV shows sir?"</p>
<p> This is a question I would expect on a first date and not by someone at a call centre. I knew where this was going but I answered regardless. "Yeah, I watch 24, FlashForward... that sort of thing. What is it to you?"</p>
<p> "I'd like to inform you of an offer we have on BT Vision this month only."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not interested."</p>
<p> "May I ask why you're not interested?"</p>
<p> "Oh that's rich. I've already ordered a service from you that isn't working but at least the telly will work and you want my money off that, is that it? There is a very specific reason why I called you guys. If I wanted TV I would have ordered a box already, but obviously this is not the case."</p>
<p> I don't know why I've even bothered. I presume most of these call centre workers get picked off the street and only know how to deal with textbook problems so I normally go easy on them. But this one was fair game. He got even more peeved when I declined his offer and asked me for a reason and I showed great restraint so as not to say anything bad about his country of origin. But in any case I never forget that I'm dealing with a person. A person that none the less at the time of their shift represents a huge cumbersome being that you cannot take on and judging by the horror stories I've read on teh interwebs it will many times play hard to get. Unless you cancel your direct debit and make them chase you for their money. When the Indian told me that someone'll call me within 48 hours and that didn't happen then I knew that they could no longer play me like that. I called them on me day off on Friday when I knew that most people would be at work and I would get through to someone quickly.</p>
<p> Bottom line: I got a new activation date for my broadband. If I don't get it, there's the High Complaints department. Then it's Oftel. Or Ofcom. Or whatever the bloody hell they're called these days.</p>

	    <p>"Enjoy sitting on that train every day?" the huge sign draped all over the new apartment complex asks us. Said apartment complex is right next to a wide band of railroad tracks.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, the train isn't that bad. It might not work often, but it's spacious and your mobile phone works. In fact I spend a lot more time changing to the (aptly nickamed) Tube and continuing my journey once in zone 1. If there was a poster at the platform advertising a new apartment complex with the tagline "As if working for 'the Man' isn't bad enough, why do you do this to yourself and become a fucking sardine twice a day" that may have affected me enough to hunt high and low for a mortgage.</p>
<p>In fact, it's not our commute those adverts should be focusing on. Commuting to work is only a byproduct of the bigger picture which is that we still have to work. However, I somehow think that "Enjoy hitting numbers on that PC 10 hours a day?" wouldn't be an incitement to buy a flat near the financial district, but rather seems like a question a bookie with balls could ask us.</p>

	    <p>I saw a Star Trek poster in the tube today. For now, I'll let slide the out-of-time-place-and-franchise figure of James T. Kirk a-lá James Dean on a bike in the center of the poster and I'll focus on the one-line reviews that appear near the fringe of the image.</p>
<p>All movie posters have one-line comments on them that go by "Brilliant", "Exceptional", "If you get to see only one movie this year make it this one", you get the drift. I don't remember seeing so many comments on any poster other than Star Trek's. Alright, so a bunch of people who get paid to see movies are telling us which ones they like, using large letters. In case we don't get the message the first time, there's not one or two one-line comments but about 15 of them, just for good measure. Who knows, maybe they'll get to turn a few people around and go see the movie. Oh, will they bog roll.</p>
<p>I wonder what it would be like once to see a poster with the usual praising one-liners and a few others thrown in along the lines of "Don't even bother mate". I suppose there's no place for "movie critics" to swim among the sea of praising comments and try to warn us not to throw money away on something they watched and found repugnant.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think Zachary Quinto did so good a job that I couldn't think of him for a second as Sylar with pointy ears.</p>
