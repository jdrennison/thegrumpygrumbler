	    <p>When we hear that someone has taken their own life we wonder who it was and that when all is said and done none of us is long for this world, really.</p>
<p>Sometimes instead of the above, we think "fucking hell, I'll miss dinner now". This is when a suicide takes place on a train track on which thousands of passengers will be travelling at peak time. Someone had the audacity to jump in front of a moving train when the rest of us have had an exhausting day and we only have a couple of hours to eat something, talk to the family and then go to bed.</p>
<p>If you think that we are insensitive for thinking that, clearly you don't live in London. And if you do, you probably haven't been living here for long and/or your job is very easy. The kind robots will be doing soon (This isn't mine. I don't know who said that). Listen how it goes for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a cat. A small, fluffy cute pet that provides you with companionship. You like the sight of it and you like stroking its back while you're watching telly, when it's home and not busy banging other cats or chasing mice.</p>
<p>One day you get back home and in the sofa there are two cats, yours and a friend of his. You discover there is no chip implant on its neck so you can't trace the owner. It's fluffy like yours and you think yours can do with a bit of company and since cats are highly independent and they'll be spending much time in the back garden you decide to keep the new cat.</p>
<p>A few days later you come back home to see the place infested with cats. So many cats in fact that you watch your step to not step on one's tail. There are cats on the telly, the sofa, the kitchen the shower, the bedroom. You find all of your decorative chinas shattered on the floor as well as all of the dishes you had placed on the dish dryer the night before. Your curtains have been ripped up and all of your furniture has scratches. In that case it may cross your mind that cats in numbers may be more of a pestilence than companionship.</p>
<p>That's what happens in big cities. I think there's far, far too many humans living in such a small space and we all know what happens to a product's value when the market is swamped with that product. We're pestilence that's racing to outnumber locusts. You see thousands of people every day on the way to work and on the way back. That's why we don't make eye contact with anyone as we enter the train. We don't acknowledge them. None of these strangers means anything to us and we think this city would be a better place to live with a 30% reduction in population. When we hear about a (corporate speak incoming) "fatality on the tracks" and it was an accident we think that were there fewer people in the platform this poor sod wouldn't have tripped over and fallen into the tracks. If it was a suicide... how would you feel if one of the tens of cats that suddenly infested your house decided to stick its paws into a wall socket and end it all? Would you curl in sorrow and wonder what its name was?</p>
<p>I've written about suicide during rush our <a title="Will I get home" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/will-i-get-home/">before</a> but in the past few weeks on two separate occasions I tried to hit on two girls who recently moved to London from the "North" and couldn't believe how desensitised we Londoners are in the face of human tragedy. I told them exactly what you read in the previous paragraphs, if you bothered to look. Did I get laid? You will never know.</p>

	  </header>
	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>Over the years I and many other Londoners have been inconvenienced by tube closures during the weekends, except the summer of 2012 when it also happened that very few of us actually cared to use it.</p>
<p>When commuting to work it sometimes breaks down. When you want to go out and pull someone, they close whole sections.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_344" align="alignnone" width="802"]<img class=" wp-image-344 " title="Tube closures" alt="Planned engineering works for the weekend. Everything will be closed. We thought to rally the troops and fix a bit of everything. Really, why do you want to go out this weekend anyway? People will be fighting everywhere and you may get caught in the middle. Also, we know and you know there's no chance of you getting hooked so there's that too. Whatever, just wait until we're done." src="/assets/tube4.jpg" width="802" height="535" /> It took me more time to find a good tube map photo than think up the punchlines and add them to it.[/caption]</p>
<p>They say the works will take <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18072.aspx">as much as 10 years</a> to complete. It's already been going on for 10 years, so it'll be 20 years when it's all done. With the advancements in engineering and technology the bits they did first will be pretty much old by the time the projected end-of-engineering-works date will arrive. But I guess as long as they're not the "break-down" type of old, everyone will be fine with it.</p>
<p>Realistically, if there's one thing that will give the Tube more than the estimated 30% capacity, that would be cutting wider tunnels and have wider trains running in them. The cost of it is prohibiting and if they were to go ahead with it they'd close parts of the tube for months or years on end. Instead, they're solving the problems of today and 80 years down the road the tube will need yet more "improvement works" and they'll be closing parts of it again until 2120.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18072.aspx#qu1">A very good FAQ section on the TFL website.</a> One of the things that will be different is that there will be air-conditioned trains when it's all done. Still no mention of being able to use a mobile phone. Last time the train came on top I remember I was so elated to get a signal to access the internet, I thought I was going to die if I couldn't read my feeds for another 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Also, no mention of any plans to deal with drunk fucks on Saturdays.</p>

	    <p>I spent two hours waiting for my train home. For the past two weeks I've been working 15 hours a day includingast weekend so when I finally managed to escape my office early for once (8.30pm) I thought I could at last put my feet up for an hour and enjoy two cups of tea.</p>
<p>And it would indeed have turned out like that if some nob wasn't hit by a train on the line that my train uses.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the details but I would think it isn't pretty when you get hit by a train so there's probably a lot of mess to clean up. And although passing trains wouldn't have much of a problem to pass through splattered brains i'm imagining this is not the case with scattered bones as those might derail a train and that's why they were "delayed". It's also an accident scene so there must be an ongoing investigation over there. Not that they've labelled it an accident. On the train website it just says that "a person was hit by a train" as if they're describing a bar fight scene.</p>
<p>I guess if it was a suicide they would have said that a "fatality" occurred or something similar. If someone fell into the gap between the train and the platform they would have used the word "injured". I guess, that is. I mean how easy is it to fall into the rail tracks with a thick yellow line that's half a meter away from the gap rim?</p>
<p>So let's assume it's a suicide. In that case I'd like to send a message out to all prospective suicide commiters. Please, pretty please with sugar on top, do kill yourselves during early office hours when there'll be plenty of time to clean up your spilled guts off the tracks before people start to leave their offices. You may have lost your jobs and can't pay your debts but throwing yourselves on the tracks when a train is passing by isn't working well for the rest of us who still have jobs and work 14 hours a day to keep them, now is it? We get home even later, we sleep even less and we are at risk of making mistakes the next day when we go to work tired. If you've read this and still want to commit suicide at/after home-time, then you're a hater and I hope you die. Err... Scrap that. I hope you'll burn in hell if there is afterlife. Which I think there isn't. But that's a topic for another entry.</p>

	    <p>After waiting 10 minutes for the ceiling mounted train table to display a platform number for my train, it finally does and I hear a few exhalation sounds from all around me just three nanoseconds before the stationary crowd becomes a moving mass directed to the platforms.</p>
<p>Yes, face it. All these people will travel on the same train as you. For only one moment you are under the illusion that most of them will be lazy fucks and won't walk all the way to the front coach where you will casually stride in, find three seats in a row waiting for you, but then you realise that you won't be traveling with lazy chavs from Charing Cross Station, but with professionals who also worked overtime like you, and they are willing to walk to the front coach.</p>
<p>As you touch  your Oyster card on the sensor, your todger goes into the behind of the woman in your front for whom the turnstile didn't open. Now I know we all tend to blame a scratched oyster card or a defec tive oyster sensor. But, really, all it takes is to firmly place your oystercard on the reader and WAIT until the doors open.<br />
Whe the train stops at your station, there are two women standing at the door in front of you and they look at each other in puzzlement one of them repeatedly presses the door button and the doors don't budge, until I point out to her that she is pressing the "close" button. Now, I don't know if women really can't read maps as per popular reputation, but I'm more inclined to take that reputation at face value after this.</p>
<p>The bus, however, is a wholly different story. There is no turnstile and if the Oyster of the poor sod in front of you doesn't check out, there's usually a good reason. You can then sneak yours by while they're pontificating whether they should pay by cash or go to the nearest convenience store and top it up. I mean, the bus will be held up for about 10 seconds but at least you will have moved well down and found yourself a nice seat, preferably without chav-marks on it. What those chav-marks may be, I will leave to your imagination.</p>
<p>Just as your bus goes through a stop or two, you hear a recorded female voice saying "This bus is on diversion." Before she can continue with "Please listen to further announcements" most people have got off their seats with discontent clearly seen on their faces. A similar scene in an Athens bus would also be accompanied by  a good proper rant by some male passengers ("fucking whore, wait till I get my hands on you") but none of that happens here. Instead, as I get off my seat I wonder what the TfL's journey planner's good for as very few people seem to use it. Then it comes down to me: I'm not the only lazy fuck on the bus.</p>
<p>I know I've pushed the envelope writing too much about public transport at the expense of other aspects of life but I'll make up for it.</p>

	    <p>So what's been happening in the past few weeks. Let's start with my pet hate subject, public transport. The ticker sign on the front and back on each coach pleads us to keep our mobile phone conversations to a minimum volume. To keep them. To a minimum. Volume. Not to make sure that everyone on the carriage knows who you fancy and that you demand to know why that report won't be in your desk in "10-15 minutes when you're in the office". I could go on my phone such as this:</p>
<p>"Alright mate? Yeah, not bad, not bad. I was just dying to know whether you shagged that bird you were talking to on Saturday. You did, eh! Attaboy! Of course she was gagging for it, that much I get. If it weren't for you, someone else would have filled in the slot. So, to business. How many times did you... MOTHERFUCKING GET OUT OF HERE! You shit me not!? Heheh, good man, mate, good man! Just next time remember to give'er one in my favour. Just to honour our friendship. Cool, man, cool. I'll speak to you soon. Bye."</p>
<p>Well, it does sound funny.</p>
<p>The voice over woman who announces the stations the train calls at sounds the same as the voice over woman who announces the bus stop the bus has been requested a stop for and the woman who happily innstructs us to go to our collection point in Argos. I wonder if these voice-over people ever give interviews, same as the woman who did an interview and does the voice-overs for Athens's Metro.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm sure morning's commuters must hate my guts to death when they hear my recorded voice saying that there is a platform alteration to the train which is due in one minute and that 80 people are waiting for. I'm currently living under 24-hour police protection. I mean I don't have it as bad as Geert Wilders or Ayaan Hirsi Ali but still."<br />
I notice fewer of those posters showing two cartoons saying towards the passenger that they will not eat smelly food or that they'll keep their feat off   vacant seats or whatever. To be completely honest, only after seeing those posters did I pontificate whether eating smelly food on the bus or train is a bad practice. After 14 hours in the office or after a big night out you just have to swing by Burger King, fight off a few chav shits who want to get a bit familiar with you and get a juicy quadruple whopper when your train is 5 minutes out. Apparently it is bad etiquette after all.</p>
<p>Speaking of chav shits, I don't think I've seen a poster with an ibred-looking cartoon saying "I will not shout at other passengers or talk to myself or throw chips around". I suppose that files under the "if you become witness of antisocial behaviour please call this number" notice which is very near the other posters. I suppose what they're going to do is chopper in within a minute of your phone call, storm the coach's doors and fire a couple rounds into the chav's chest. If that preferable option is not feasible they have to have cops or rail enforcement officers at the next station or the one next to it shoud they miss the train.</p>
<p>Those of the "antisocial behaviour" exhibitors who aren't reported or escape arrest wind up in a tourist resort in Greece a few months later. Thankfully, hundreds of miles away from my hometown.</p>
<p>Their capital is the Burger King inside Charing Cross rail station. At least their single brain cell is enough of white matter to dictate to them that they should queue for their burger. It is, however, not enough to instruct them that they must not treat the person in front of or behind them as if they're best mates. If you stay away from council flats, which I presume that you do since you are at least articulate enough to read this text, the Burger King in Charing Cross station -( bit more difficult but not impossible) and, finally, Southeastern Rail trains (for many reasons other than this too) then you're in the clear.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that chav behaviour should be met with punitive force and not seen as a disease that needs to be cured.</p>

	    <p>What did I learn from going to the Clapham Common fireworks display and missing it? </p>
<p> Up until a few years ago, every single time I took the metro or overground train and my mum was with me, as soon as we got on the train she would always point to a couple of empty seats at the back and go "look there's one over there, hurry, sit down!". I'd never do that. I don't know why, but I was always very relaxed about it. Perhaps I thought standing would be a good exercise or was even feeling sorry for those elderly people who were mixing with daytime workers on the coach. Although, just like pregnant women and buggy pushers they shouldn't be really mixing with the productives during rush hour, I would think "eff it, they're here now so". My mum would wait until I went for the seat and when I said "no mum, you sit, I'm fine standing" she would make a face when someone else would ultimately go sit on the once empty seat. </p>
<p> Things are different now. Senior citizens in London know better than taking the train at rush hour. The same can be said of pregnant women for the most part, but not of proud mothers with buggies. And my compassion has diminished ever since I was introduced to the daily grind. You want me to move down the train? Tough shit, get the next one which, by the way is running as close as 30 seconds to this one, so there is no reason to hold up this one for a good 3 minutes just because everybody has to get in. Don ask us in that patronising/mistress tone to move down the train. You know what, people don't mone down the train. They make faces and ignore you. We all hope that you'll give up and wait for the next train which, if I haven't mentioned it already, is 30 seconds behind this one and is waiting for our one to leave so it can enter the station. What part of "this train is now ready to depart" are you having trouble understanding? Good people have missed a good fireworks display cos of some bitches who weren't waiting their turn. </p>
<p> That's how come I stopped caring. Everyone of them is just a number. I will push to get on the train. I will not show signs of chivalry when I see an empty seat. Here it's every man for himself. </p>
<p> When British Rail and the Tube were first introduced they must have been such pioneering achievements. Multiple levels above or below ground, with signs that even someone with the brain of an amoeba can't get wrong. No amount of improvement, however, can cope woth the ever increasing London population. </p>

	    <p>You should have seen me puff when fast pacing to the train station this morning. I got on the train after all but only because it was to stay on the station for 10 minutes before it was cleared for departure. And this is where realisation came down.</p>
<p>You will probably agree that this city has far too many people. Imagine what your life in London would be like if the population here was 40% less than it is now. Yes, I know it's mostly immigrants like me who make things worse but what would you have done in my place? Anyway, it's times like these when you realise how overcrowded this place is. It's a scene that repeated itself many times before. The train remains stationary indefinitely whilst we are standing inside crammed like sardines and those of us who can get a glimpse at the platform can see everyone else who arrives later than us and scans the train doors cursorily. We all hope that whatever they plan to do will involve moving down the platform and trying another door. Some of them do. Some others want to become your enemy, mumble a cursory "excuse me" and get in through the same door you did and squeeze themselves next to you.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, the temperature is 25C and some "fellow" passengers didn't take a shower before leaving for work. This means that while you leave your house squeaky clean, by the time you get to the office you smell other people's scents and your coworkers will have to endure that for at least 8 hours.</p>
<p>I'm surprised that everyone takes this without  complaint. I remember when I had to do this in my country. Now, anyone who has visited Greece must have realised we are a very gregarious people. A similar scene at a train station during rush hour would be amusing to say the least.</p>
<p><em>"Move down the train, we can't get inside"</em></p>
<p><em>"Well, lady, you can see we're packed. Try another door."</em></p>
<p><em>"Why, I still see some space there somewhere."</em></p>
<p><em>"There's no space, go somewhere else"</em></p>
<p><em>"For Christ's sake!" (tries to squeeze in, pisses off everybody she pushes) </em></p>
<p><em>"Which part of 'piss off' don't you understand?"</em></p>
<p><em>(Loudly)"Well, you have the manners of a fucking Paki(*), you know that? Is that what you are? A smelly Paki?"</em></p>
<p>A trip by tube had to ensue next as I was going to be late for work otherwise. It's far worse down under as there is no fresh air to come through the windows.</p>
<p>This photo was taken 11 hours later back in London Bridge.</p>

<p>I normally associate all those "Delayed" notifications with a movie where a catastrophic terrorist attack is imminent and all flights or train services have been put on hold until the affected area is cleared. Later on, "Delayed" becomes "Cancelled", which means that conventional means failed to take down the terrorist threat and the protagonist must come in. I didn't stay in London Bridge long enough to see "Delayed" change to anything else.</p>
<p>The official story was that there was a lineside fire in the London Bridge area. It was either that or someone wanted to call it an early evening and came up with that elaborate excuse. I mean, does anyone really and truly know what a "lineside fire" even mean other that it's something that emerges just make you see your partner and kids with a two hour delay?</p>
<p>It may have taken them one hour to resume the trains, it could still be going on. Fuck in heaven knows. I can visualise the railtrack repairmen work 15 minutes at a time and take 45 minute long tea breaks in between and all that while getting paid by the hour. After all, it's not like we can somehow retaliate. Can we switch from our current provider and buy monthly travelcards to use with a different railway company that uses different, weather and fire-resistant railways and trains with larger people capacity that get us where we want to go without any delays? If we get to work 35 minutes late can we advise our friends not to use Southeastern Rail because, say, company XYZ does the same route but is on time more often for 3/4 of the current monthly fare? Can we balls.</p>

<p>(*) Back home we're still allowed to talk like that. In public. Regardless whether Pakistani immigrants are around and listening. And I can attest that this exchange did happen.</p>

	    <p>It beggars fucking belief. For many weeks the Jubilee line has been closed on weekends.</p>
<p>Jubilee Line is one of the most modern-looking tube lines which connects together a great deal of south east London. I don't know how they are "transforming our tube" and it probably will be a seemless operation to us anyway. After they're done with the transformations we will continue taking the tube as before and still be crammed in like sardines during the rush hour.</p>
<p>I wonder if someone high up in the TFL chain of command wakes up on a Monday morning and thinks "right, whose weekend shall I fuck up this week? Ah yeah, these fuckers living in Rotherhithe, Canada Water, West Hampstead, St John's Wood and Swiss Cottage have had it easy until now, how about I go about having Jubilee Line closed every weekend for the next six months?"</p>
<p>We wouldn't have had any of this if it weren't for the Olympics and a handful of wealthy foreigners who will use the Tube for two weeks and will then leave never to be seen or heard from again. Who gives a shit for the residents of this town who will remain here after the Olympics have finished? If we are benefited at all by this "transformation" it will be nothing but a side effect.</p>

	    <p>Those "don't assault our staff" adverts are everywhere. For good reason indeed as there are plenty of <a title="We've talked about this before" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/human-wastelands/" target="_blank">subhuman cunts</a> who can't seem to know how to behave themselves. Today I saw another one on the DLR:</p>
<blockquote><p>I spat on a member of staff and thought nothing of it. A few months later, I was arrested.</p>
<p><em>Abuse, Assault, Arrest: Our staff are here to help you. Spitting on DLR staff is classified as an assault and is a criminal offence. Saliva Recovery Kits are now held on every train and will be used to identifty offenders against the national DNA database.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Let's get real here: The staff is not here to help us, they're here to put food on their table and maybe give some directions, although to take the DLR from A to B should be, as Americans would say, "a no brainer". But in any case they do have the right to work without the fear of threats or violence.</p>
<p>But the bottom line of this entry is that I can't for the life of me understand who in their right mind would spit on another human being who at the end of the day are just working their shift and want to get home to their families. Why would someone spoil another person's day like that? Especially in the DLR where interaction with staff is minimal. But apparently there are enough such incidents so that they put up those posters on DLR coaches.</p>
<p>What's next, chavs taking a shit on their palm and throwing it at rail staff?</p>

	    <p>I felt relieved at the fact I left the office so early in about a year; 6.30 pm. I was at the train station at a few minutes to 7 waiting for the 19:00 train home. It never showed up. The next one was at 19:10 so I waited. After making sure that the electronic announcement board mentioned the station I wanted to get off to, I got in.  It was the wrong train after all.</p>
<p>I got off at the first station the train stopped and which was a few tens of miles from where I wanted to get off. I went to the opposite platform to get on the next train that was going in the same direction I came from and would come in no earlier than 25 minutes.</p>
<p>You know the story; it’s rush hour, everybody is fighting off a few hundreds of other people on the train platforms trying to find a free slot behind the yellow line, there’s noise, commotion and you’ve had 9rough hours at work. You won’t notice anything as petty as the company branding or the interior of the train and how different these two are from the ones on the trains you normally take to and from work. Besides, it’s rush hour and some companies service may be serving some extra routes for all I know.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ended up at the outer boundaries of Zone 6 and my main concern was whether I was going to bump into a conductor on my way back as I wasn’t going to paya single extra penny for a mistake I’m solely putting the blame on them? At this instance it’s the company that manages the station from which I take the train home. Well, come to think about it I might as well lay the blame to all the other passengers that get in my way by having the preposterous idea of returning to their homes at the same time as I. What wouldn’t I give to find a desolate platform on which I can walk around freely while waiting for a non-delayed train to come and take me.</p>
