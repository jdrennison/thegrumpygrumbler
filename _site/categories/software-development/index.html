	    <p><strong>Dear Uncle JD,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have been in my current role of Senior Developer for a software agency for about a year now. As my job title suggests, I should be someone who makes decisions and also improves the software methodologies of the organisation. But ever since I started working here, I've been adding buttons on web pages, adding fields into HTML forms, writing API calls or adding optional properties to entities on said APIs. I get pressured by project managers to lower my effort points and time estimates because "the client won't like this and may take their business elsewhere" and then insist to take 20% off those time estimates and turn them into deadlines. I'm the sole developer for many projects.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We nominally do code reviews but more often than not they never get done as everyone else is busy with their own tight deadlines. My project managers always push for the quick-and-dirty solution "just for now" so we can get something "out of the door". The result of this is that I lose interest in the work I'm doing and I often cobble something up just to get it out of the way and relieve some stress on me and yet I still stay in the office until 8pm every weeknight. Of course, it goes without saying that we never revisit that old code to make it right, after all, refactoring released code isn't adding functionality and isn't putting food on the table. Instead, we keep adding functionality to the spaghetti code out there and I find myself slowing down and working harder to manually test everything as a result of this. I now think I'm exhibiting OCD symptoms before a deployment to production. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My question to you is this: am I a complete knobhead for not speaking up more often and getting my point across, or just a partial one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Idiotic and dismayed</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Idiotic and Dismayed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I'm fully aware that technical staff such as devs, DBAs and Ops do everything in their power to avoid conflict. We prefer to work with machines rather than people as machines are more predictable and they don't have the downside of a personality being attached to them, though it may so seem every time you're getting an "Object reference is not set to an instance of an object" error.</p>
<p>As technical staff you want to take the "path of least resistance" when it comes to interacting with people who "don't get the code". This often leads to the problems you've described. Perhaps there'll be a little back-and-forth and the PM may make a concession or two but, let's come off it, if we were good with people and were able to get a point across, we'd be PMs ourselves. </p>
<p>After all how many software job adverts have you not seen in recent years where they're asking for people who can communicate with non-technical staff? I mean they've really got a front to ask for this, haven't they? Sure, at the university you've done a lot of by-now-outdated courses that simulated a software team in a company but you knew this isn't real and if it's anything like that when you get your first job, it'll be fine. Well, it <em>is</em> like that at your first job but instead of other clueless second-years you have seasoned 50 year-old project managers wanting things from you so they can feed their families and you can feed yours. That shit is real and there's no denying it.</p>
<p>When you were thinking of responding to their job opening, what else on the job spec? Did it say that you have to be able to meet tight deadlines and work under pressure? If so, they really meant it. They're not actually saying "there'll be the occasional tight deadline but for most of the time you'll be alright" but "you have to release yesterday every day and you'll be managing multiple projects on the same day, alternating every half an hour with people moaning to your PM over the phone". </p>
<p>Nobody said it was going to be easy, my boy.</p>

	    <p>Some of us are coding for a living. Anyone who says this isn't hard business, I dare to come write code, attend meetings, plan tasks, estimate time frames, write clean code and be there at 3AM for server maintenance.</p>
<p>But this isnt about all that. This is about learning new skills every couple of years at most, and that's pushing it.</p>
<p>If you're a doctor or a lawyer you can relate. New medical techniques come out all the time, new cures are invented. Maybe you're one of the people doing the inventing. New laws are voted all the time and others change. And in software development, new technologies emerge almost every day. As far as the end user is concerned, marketers are just shoving down the users' throats just another way of doing something they're already doing until they buy it. But for the developer who programs the software in your devices, it's a living. In the olden days of 2006, you could be irrelevant in five years if you didn't make an effort to update your skills. Now this is down to two. As technology has become cheap to produce and continuous delivery has made software release more often, we're bombarded by new software that we can use to build other software all the time.</p>
<p>Keeping up with all this technology requires at least another 40 hours a week if you're not just reading books and journals but you get "hands on" with some new shit in order to get practical experience too. </p>
<p>If you're a potential employer how do you hire developers who are up to date with cutting edge technologies and demonstrate that they won't start wrapping things up for the day when the clock strikes 4.50pm but also won't feel that other aspects of their lives are being neglected if they work unpaid overtime often? </p>
<p>I'm here to help. None of the ideas below is mine, I've looked at various job postings from start-ups looking for software developers and engineers and have compiled a list of requirements I've found in those. They're all looking for "passionate" developers who do as many of the following as possible.</p>
<h3>Github profile</h3>
<p>If you're not commiting to Github often, it's safe to assume thay when you go home you do other things than coding. You're quite likely to do a worse job than developers who <em>do</em> make regular commits to open source repositories because these other people just <em>so can't get out of it</em> they use much of their free time to code and it doesn't look like it's burning them out. Also, they've most certainly had more practice under their belts and they'll make better candidates.</p>
<p>Also, as most of the code people write is commercial and closed source, we can only tell what sort of coder you are if you have some code samples of yours uploaded somewhere.</p>
<p>In fact some employers don't even bother with CVs anymore. Go to Github right now or you simply don't exist.</p>
<h3>Blogs</h3>
<p>Unless you want the hiring manager to assume that it's all take-take-take with you, you'd better have a blog where you contribute articles to the software community. In an era of instant global communication, there is so much demand for answers and ideas in this field that one blog and one framework per developer <em>still</em> won't saturate the Internet. This is not only true for developers alive today but for all new industry entrants from now until technology lets us down and we decide to ban it.</p>
<p>So go and buy some hosting space and set up a blog using a well-known CMS with a large community. It will only take an hour. Come on, I'll wait.</p>
<p>I know you've still here. Get moving!</p>
<p>Alright, future unemployed developer, I don't care. It's on you.</p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p>Because we want to know your thoughts about all things programming and if you're following the industry leaders we like. We also want to see a glimpse of your character.</p>
<h3>Stack Overflow</h3>
<p>Do you participate in heated debates about what constitutes a single responsibility of a module? Do you answer questions as often as we want to see someone answer questions? Oh, come on, now, be social. It's pretty much the same as maintaining a blog, sharing ideas and all, only this time you're helping someone who's asked for help. </p>
<h3>Open source projects</h3>
<p>That kind of looks like the Github one but we're talking about full-fledged solo or team projects already released or with a clear and promised intent to be released. In other words it's not you just experimenting and generally mucking anout. This is your opportunity to shine. Hey, I've helped made this! Maybe it's something the technical director of the hiring company is already brought to the organisation or considering using and has heard your name as one of the contributors. <em>I'm lucky enough this bloke's looking for work right now</em>, he'll think.</p>
<p>Of course, it could well be that you write splendid code while you're at work, that makes PMs, clients and stakeholders happy and you do none of these other things. The problem is that the hiring manager of the company you want to work for can't see the work you're doing on your 9-to-5 because it's proprietary. We thought of portfolios as something designers and front-end web developers do to show their work when they're between jobs but this has now spread to back-end developers. Next thing you know, DBAs will need to present a portfolio when they're being interviewed.</p>
<p>It's difficult to keep up with new technology as software creation has become so cheap a process you can potentially have one or more frameworks per developer. I'd say this is especially harder for people with  family commitments as they have their family commitments intervene, but I won't because that would be marital-statusism. The world is already unfair enough to single people once they've passed 30. It's more difficult to get a work visa somewhere when you don't have a partner to apply together with. Holiday packages are cheaper per person if two people travel together. Food portions in grocery stores always seem too much if you're only feeding yourself so you have to store it in the freezer but some food was frozen before it was sold and cannot be refrozen. Single workers apparently have no excuse not to study work-related things outside of work as what's perceived as the most important commitment outside of work is not applicable in their case. You hear this often: "I'd love to code outside of work but I've got a family and I can't find much time". Well, shit. I've got friends,  a girlfriend, I go out more often since I'm young and pretty and want to be seen and I've got a few other hobbies and interests. Maybe I'll even work the fuck out if I'm feeling special. And if I'm not, I'll stay at home, watch internet porn and have a wank because I've had a long day and it's still Tuesday, so fuck right fucking off. In short, I'm just as busy as a married with children person and my day is just 24 hours long as theirs. But no, if you're not committed to a married life all your activities outside of work are sacrificeable to maintain a technology blog, commit to Github often and contribute to open source projects, be on Twitter and answer questions on Stack Overflow. You need to update your skills all the time because new things come out all the time and there's no end in it. Do away with personal care. No one needs a shower every fucking day and if you're not client-facing you don't even need to be clean shaven. Or trim your stubble. </p>
<p>This is a hypercompetitive and materialistic world and you're a talented developer in a city full of them. But do all that and you'll keep abreast of those that don't, and eliminate a large chunk of the competition. Because if you become complacent, your time <em>will</em> come,  <em>you fat, bearded, cheetos-eating, Dr. Pepper-drinking, World of Warcraft-playing, nose-picking and snot-eating motherfucking fuck-shit</em>. This is a global depression we're living in. Employers have become more selective so if you don't want to die in a cardboard box, you'd better do as I'm telling you.</p>
<p>And when you're made redundant at 55 and can't find another job because you're overqualified and can be replaced by someone with half the experience and money, you'll wish you had spent some of that time going out more often, making friends and finding a girlfriend.</p>

	    <p>The week is near the end and as we all know the weekend starts on Friday at 6pm. All week's been quiet in that my PM (Product Manager or Project Manager, pick one) has asked me "how's it going" only once. With only one hour to go, I'm half way through running a deployment script on one of the two boxes where the production code is running.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_724" align="aligncenter" width="408"]<a href="https://thegrumbler.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/fridaydeployment.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-724" src="assets/fridaydeployment.gif" alt="asd" width="408" height="285" /></a> <br />Maybe I'll do it after a few pints at the local near the office.[/caption]</p>
<p>"JD." I hear a voice right above me. I turn around to see the stern face of my PM. "Did you get my email?"</p>
<p>Without answering I look back at the monitor, hover my mouse cursor over Outlook and start sifting through its open email windows seeking the only window that contains the inbox.</p>
<p>The problem with emails is that no tree needs to be cut down to become raw material for a on-screen window with text and images. Also you can send one without having to get off your seat. As a result, hundreds of them fly across the corporate network every day without any thought. Me, I get tens of the buggers daily, many of them being automatic updates from the CI build server or other services we use, many others have me on the CC field and therefore most of the time the email doesn't even remotely concern me. Sometimes I will get an email directly personally to me. My PM had just sent me one at 16:10. It was now 16:11.</p>
<p>"Did I get it? Yes, I did. Did I act on it? No. I didn't even look at it as I'm in the middle of the release we agreed doing today. May I remind you how we communicate urgencies in this company but also in every company. We're all busy with things. If you want me to look at something within a couple of hours or more, you email me. If you want something in the next five to ten minutes you instant-message me. And if it's urgent come find me."</p>
<p>The PM exhales "well, just read the bloody email".</p>
<p>You know, when you're deeply in "The Zone" and someone disrupts your trail of thoughts? Developers have a lot of tiny bits of information in their heads when they're working at a difficult problem. We can't really keep notes about those bits in a notepad because even the very act of keeping notes is a process that requires effort that we're spending thinking things and the slightest distraction would shatter out concentration. We can access those things in our short-term memory more quickly without writing and reading. That's because new things keep piling up in our short-term memory as we're working through a problem yet we can still dance trough them all. Until someone interrupts us. Everyone knows that context switching is an expensive mental process. Everything we've had in our minds so far gets shattered to make room for the new situation at hand. That someone deserves our wrath.</p>
<p>Uncle Bob Martin's interpretation of "The Zone"<a href="%20is not the same as my one"> is not the same as my one</a>. "The Zone" is your friend.</p>
<p>"We know about this", I reply after reading the very long stack trace that the PM emailed me, still staring at my monitor. "I thought it was being looked at by the team that handles that system. You need to speak to that team."</p>
<p>"Oh, ok. I'll ask them then", says the PM and briskly walks off. If there's anything else I can't help you with, come and ask.</p>
<p>First production server done, monitor the logs for a while and if all goes well, move to the second box.</p>
<p>"JD". That was one of the mobile app developers. "I've made a call to the API from the app and I got a 500 Internal Server Error."</p>
<p>When you've pushed, or in this case, are pushing, a new deployment to the production servers and someone reports that something's fucking fucked up in the application that you've released, the first thing that comes to your mind is whether it's something that you've just changed or something that has been there for a while but it so happened that someone's just noticed it. Before we release an application to production, it is now common in most companies that we have automated tests that exercise various paths of the application. If one of them fails, the build is unfit for release and we have to work out what's wrong with the tested code (or the test that failed) before we release. All tests had passed in that instance but the problem is those tests are never exhaustive. The journeys a user can take and the inputs she can enter (see? I'm not sexist. I can throw a few "she" around to keep the Brigade of Political Correctness at bay) are practically infinite and there could be a case that wasn't covered by tests. If your company has a Quality Assurance team they may find it during their exploration testing. Some other times the requirements could miss out some use cases in which case the production software may behave in an undesirable way. This type of behaviour we call an unintended feature. Also, some of the codebase is years old, people leave and join a company all the time and the person or persons who wrote a piece of logic and/or the PM who ordered it may be long gone or on holiday. The rest of us, who don't know that specific logic off the top of our heads will have to dig in and find what it does, so that is man-minutes, and sometimes man-hours, spent there.</p>
<p>In short, anyone who isn't shocked by the art of software development clearly hasn't undestood what it's about. So those who don't understand software development have us do it instead and sometimes when we give them feedback we receive responses such as "but we're already doing this somewhere else in the platform" or "we've got a last-minute change one hour before the deadline but it shouldn't take you long".</p>
<p>And what could unintended features be like? Like bloody anything! Here's a transcript of the conversation between the mobile app developer and me:</p>
<p>"Hey man," I said, "I'll look at it when I get the chance but right now I'm in the middle of a release. Next time you discover a bug, could you discover it when I'm not doing a release?"</p>
<p>"This can't wait, I'm afraid. As soon as the error occurred, the laptop next to me has just become sentient and has produced legs and a gatling gun between them. Also the printer in the corridor has become an aerial hunter-killer drone and started firing missiles on the accounts team".</p>
<p>Moral of the story: a reminder that when native British people answer with "I'm afraid that..." they mean "I don't care a tiny bit about what you want and why, just shut up and do what they're tellin' ya".</p>

	    <p>"When was the last time you saw Mr. David Anderson?" asked the Met detective.<br />
"Well, he came to the office two days ago, went on his lunch break and never came back." said the director.<br />
"His wife called the office the next day and when we told her he's not come back since last afternoon she said she would call the police"<br />

"He is an IT project manager. He manages the timescales and the delivery of our technology projects".<br />

"Of course. Oh there's something else which I don't know if it matters much but I think I should tell you anyway. The last thing he said before he disappeared was to one of the guys in the development team. I overheard him because I happened to be walking by at the time."<br />
"He said. 'It can't be a big job can it? We are already doing this in another part of the codebase'."</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p style="text-align:justify;">One of the complaints we hear from our users is that the software we ship to then should "just work".  They shouldn't anticipate a potential bug every other week and if they do we should be able to respond to it immediately.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This should indeed be the case. The software we make is supposed to "just work". After all, this is what you would expect from the manufacturer of your car, isn't it?. You should be able to trust your car and not be afraid that something will fall off the engine when you do 70 on the motorway. Ok, there needs to be some common sense of your part as in drive at the correct speeds for the gear the car is on and also have it serviced after a certain number of kilometres but other than that you would expect it to just be a black box and give you what you need.</p>

<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">"Could a dev look into the blown engine issue as a matter of urgency and push a fix to production asap please."</p>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, every software has bugs. Every time I see the words "known issues" on the readme of a piece of software I download I think that if I do this and I click that, will the whole thing bomb out? If the dev who wrote this knows this what's he doing right now? Is he working to fix it as we speak or is he thinking "fuck it, I've told my customer base what the fuck will happen when you do this and that so I'll fix it maybe next week"?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"We will not ship shit", said <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/09/06/I-am-Your-New-CTO.html">someone</a>. "No amount of management yelling will ever make us ship shit." That would be nice wouldn't it? We should say no every time we think we can't deliver something in the time frames we're proposed and give honest estimates instead. And always do it right. It doesn't matter if we don't ship all the features</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, we seem to think that bugs are a natural part of the software life cycle. "There will always be bugs" is what I've lost count hearing. I'd like to meet the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">man</span> person who's come up with that directive. What we dislike most about our job isn't the testing. It's the bug fixing. It's the investigating in order to find out why the fuck something isn't working right and whether whoever wrote it was daydreaming of beaches and fit birds at the time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">Not to worry, they'll get the new guy to fix that 500 error they see on every page.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I've concluded that there are three reasons why we ship shit.</p>
<h5 style="text-align:justify;">Software development is a creative process</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We get user stories and requirements from the business. We architect the software and materialize those stories in code. If we need clarification we go back to the business and ask for it. I'd rather not have to do this (see reason No. 2 below) but just get everything at once and the requirements be clear. If the customer changes their mind, I'd like to know about it and get the whole story again without the need to ask for clarification. I will think "wouldn't it be better if they had fucking made up their minds when the requirements first came in" but I won't say a word because the customer is always right and pays for my lifestyle.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-288" alt="Image" src="/assets/sp_wow.jpg" /></div>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">No, this is now behind me. No, really, it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The "problem" comes from this: software development is a creative process. It's an art. I equate myself with the street artist that paints your portrait while you feel your muscles hurt while trying to hold still. Imagine telling the painter this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"We need to get the ears out first. What's your estimate for the ears? Let's prioritize this and then the nose. How hard is it to make that? 5 story points?"</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" alt="" src="/assets/portrait.png" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">There's your portrait mate, now off ye fuck.</p>
<p>No matter how hard we try to stick to requirements and use cases and worse case scenarios, there is always room for misinterpretation. Irrespective of how clear an idea you think your have about how your software needs to work, there are ten ways of doing the same thing. There are differences of opinion and perspective. Due to the novelty of each project there is always some amount of uncertainty with respect to its execution. Most of the time and only while you're down to the code, you will think of a use case or an edge scenario that hadn't come up in the meetings. The product managers won't know the answer to that and not even the client will; they will have to think some shit up and you'll have to wait until said shit comes down the chain. This, I call work disruption, a culprit for introducing bugs as we're juggling with multiple logical aspects in our short term memory while some exec didn't think every possible outcome of how the fucking thing should do its job. And this won't happen only once or twice a week.</p>
<h5>We don't like to push back</h5>
<p>We're tech people, not exactly renowned for our people skills. Some of us are downright socially inept. In the Gaussian distribution of software developers those would sit on one end. On the other end are those with good people skills, usually get sick and tired of coding and ever-changing technologies and eventually  become managers. The rest of us struggle to keep up with ever-changing methodologies and technologies until... well I don't know. I've not seen many old programmers around and I doubt they all become managers.</p>
<p>Well, my point is that when we smell conflict on the horizon we do our best to avoid it like the motherfucking plague. "Can you do this feature in two days", asks your project manager with a look that says "You better say fucking yes to that". No. I can't. If I say it'll take four days it'll take four days. I will explain to my best of my abilities why it could take so long but if the reason is that I'm new to this project or platform or the company or that the existing code base looks like the spaghetti I had last night that caused me to do a shit three times between the morning and the afternoon, I'll keep this to myself. At least this is what we should do. Instead we reluctantly agree and some of us even go as far as to say "I'll try" which is code for "Fuck off, it's four days and if you don't like it, tough shit mate".</p>
<p>We are hired to say "no". It won't make us heroes. Yet, we are the technical authority. The project manager, savvy as he* may be, could be more accurate in an estimate. As in, if he has worked with other devs who know a project better than you, he might call you out on this. "But seriously this should take far less". Should it bollocks. You do the work, you provide the estimate and this is the estimate he should hold you to. If he doesn't like it he can get another dev to do the work and you can work on that exciting greenfield project that never seem to be taking off.</p>
<h5>Some of us don't think this is as important as making cars.</h5>
<p>Cars have to be robust and as a non-car mechanic, non-car maker you just have to bestow trust upon it to get you from A to B without killing you and I don't know about you but I don't remember incidents of deaths by car failure - if the car is new or well-maintained.</p>
<p>When a bug needs to be fixed "urgently", you might think "what's the urgency? Does a person die every minute I spend not fixing this?". Unless you work in the healthcare sector, no one will die if your software has a bug. So the most likely case is that for every minute you haven't pushed a fix to production someone is losing hundreds or thousands of pounds per minute. "Money is different, no one dies". Maybe so. Because like the rest of us you live in a non-capitalist economy and money doesn't move the world. No need to worry yourself sick if lives don't depend on your software but if someone tells you to fix something you fucking fix it.</p>
<p>Then find which monkey coded this piece of shit and make sure he doesn't live to see another day for making you stay late... oh it was you six months ago wasn't it.</p>
<p>So this notion of "fuck it, software will always have bugs", I cannot accept. As professionals we have to always strive to improve software quality. In the private sector there's pressure to get out new features and get them out fast. And we don't like to push back because we are tech people and we like talking to computers more than talking to people. Because computers are deterministic and non-unpredictable. Unless the software they run on has bugs.</p>
