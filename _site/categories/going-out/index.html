	  </header>
	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>I took advantage of the national holiday that was and headed for the beach.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-557" src="/assets/beach1.jpg" alt="British Beach" width="676" height="492" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">Well, whatever passes for a beach here, that is.</p>
<p>My first order of business was to get to know the town I just found myself in so I took one of the open decked tour buses that seem to be in every city and town in the world. After all, what's a better way to see a new place than have a local tour guide show you around? Then you'll have more time in your hands to have a stroll in the same high street as in your own town, with the same chain coffee shops, the same chain restaurants, the same chain bookstores, when high streets had bookstores. When food replicators like those in Star Trek are made there won't be any coffee shops and restaurants in the high street either. I'm pretty sure that the only thing that would survive are the pubs.</p>
<p>But I digress. Going back to the tour bus, the thing was parked in the town centre and the tour guide was singing something loudly along the lines of "The best way to see the town and the surrounding areas is by our open top tour bus, you'll spend two unforgettable hours on the tour bus"... you get the idea. "I'd like one adult ticket", I tell him. In case he mistook me for a toddler or an elderly man, of course. Then he taps me on the shoulder and says "get on board and we'll come find you, my friend".</p>
<p>He... tapped me on the shoulder and called me "my friend". This is how the people of the countryside differ from those living in London. In London, the longest conversation you would have with a stranger is when you slightly brush them on the tube, say "sorry" without looking at them in the eye and continue on your merry way. Except on a Saturday night that instead of "sorry" the other person <em>will</em> look at you in the eye and say "oi, you got a problem, bruv?".</p>
<p>During the bus tour, the weather went from sunny to cloudy and then overcast and rain. As I got off the bus he, the guide, said "you just know the weather will be bad when there's a bank holiday". The surprise didn't come right away. Firstly, the reminder sank in that on 6 out of 8 public holidays in the year the weather is utter shit. Then there was the suprise. Hang on, what just happened, I thought to myself. He, the guide, a complete stranger to me, was making small talk? He was chatting to me about the weather and that bank holidays like to bring it down on us. I looked at him as though he'd offered to fill my water bottle with some of his piss.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, you have the fewest public holidays in Europe but remember that at least you have public paid holidays. Now you also want clear skies with them? It's all take, take, take with you lot.</p>
<p>- The Man</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me digress once more, because I like to do so. "Bank" holidays. They call them that because banks are closed during that time and therefore do not handle money. If they don't handle money, no other business can work as the bank is the middleperson (P.C. for middleman) in every transaction. So it's the bank's holiday first and everyone else's second, by consequence. If you wanted to know who really runs the place, you didn't have to experience a financial recession to find out. You needn't have seen the media get all worked up about bankers getting bonuses that's twenty times your salary. The name Bank Holiday is indication enough.</p>
<p>So, weather talk. Typically at this time of the year you can't predict the bloody thing. I was wearing a t-shirt, a shirt and a thin denim jacket. Sometimes it was too warm and I had to take off the jacket. The next minute it was too cold. I am normally not bothered by this as I normally look out of the window in the morning to decide what to wear and if the sky is relatively blue I go "fuck it, short sleeve and the leather jacket it is". I can handle the walk to the tube station/bus stop, weather conditions don't affect me when I'm commuting and there's heat or air conditioning in the office. When I go out, only the venue changes. But it's a wholly different story if I'm travelling lightly for a few days in the spring and I'm out and about all the time. Wear a warm jacket and you'll sweat your bollocks off when the sun comes out. Wear a thin denim jacket and your bollocks will freeze when the sun hides behind a cloud layer or when it's overcast. What I've found that works is to get a backpack with clothes that cover each eventuality but you'll have to be carrying with you always since there's a high likelihood you'll need any and all of the packed garments within an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Nightlife</strong></p>
<p>The night is in full swing and on Friday and Saturday some pubs are allowed to trade for longer than during the rest of the week. Great news! So instead of getting kicked out at 11 you're allowed to stay and drink until midnight. If you wwant to carry on drinking you'll have to go to a club.</p>
<p>I've not seen many differences from London, really, apart from the fact that these places must be full of locals every week. You would think you can't afford to get in a brawl as those you were playing "let's punch each other in the bollocks" with the night before you'll see in a restaurant next week when you take out a first date. Just like in London, everything has a bouncer outside because presumably no one can go and enjoy a few beers without getting into a fight with someone. In fact I've seen it so often that I'm now paraphrasing Arthur Clarke's third law:</p>
<p><em>Any sufficiently advanced number of late night drunken incidents is indistinguishable from premeditated attempts to commit violence on behalf of the general populace.</em></p>
<p>So I'm now pretty sure that lots of people before they go out they think "whoa, what a fucking week that was, I just can't wait to go drink six beers and then punch in the teeth the first unlucky sod I cross paths with".</p>
<p>Other sights include long queues to get into a cheap bar and get cheap shots.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-590 " src="/assets/club-queue-e1401923024928.jpg?w=204" alt="Club Queue" width="300" height="441" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">I've queued for far too long to be turned away by you fluorescent jerkin twats. Here's my ID.</p>
<p>I saw lots of girls that would have done everyone a favour if they either stayed at home or inform us where they're going to be spending the night so we won't be going there. And because these days everyone likes to share the innards of their souls on the Internet, I am offering to write an app that aggregates women's status updates about where they're going when they're going out. To be featured in the data aggregation, the woman must have a sufficiently large Kitsch Index, which will be determined by whether she has selfies on her Facebook and Instagram and how much she looks like white trash. Then the data will be displayed on a layered Google Maps map where you can see the trends of the evening.</p>
<p>Seriously. What we see in any given evening cannot be unseen and if our retinas could speak they would beg us "please, no more!" after the repeated rapings they have suffered.</p>
<p><strong>Fancy dress without being out on a hen night.</strong></p>
<p>If I don't see any ribbons around their torso I just assume they're not celebrating their girlfriend entering married life. Instead, I always assume they had thought "girls, what are we doing tomorrow evening? I say we snag some used PVC nurse uniforms from the dustbins outside the Brazzers studio and hit the town!" Nobody finds it sexy or cute. If men are looking at you it's because they're thinking "what attention fucking slappers they are". Seriously, I've never seen anyone busting a move on women wearing fancy dresses at a club.</p>
<p>Moving on. Barefoot fat chick holding her £10 shoes from Missbehaving in her hand. Not sexy. Give it up. Well we're partially responsible for that too. You see, someone like her will always find someone eager to find just another hole to shove his rod through, no matter whether he is in a relationship or not and chances are it won't even be as good. Hugh Grant used to do Liz Hurley and yet elected to mess around with an ugly prostitute. If Hugh Grant did that, imagine the lengths that you'd go to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-605" src="/assets/mainssocket.png" alt="Mains Socket" width="255" height="272" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">Tell me you wouldn't smash that.</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>I've been tied up with various shit lately. You know you've been away from blogging for too long when they've changed the home page so much that you think you've mistyped the URL. I've been meaning to write something about office Christmas parties for about a week now, since we've had ours, but due to the verbosely described reasons above, I postponed it until today.</p>
<p>I googled the following terms the other day:<br />
"office christmas party" "do I have to go"<br />
"office christmas party" "don't want to go"<br />
"avoid the office christmas party"</p>
<p>I suppose I was trying to locate a genuine, heart-to-heart anonymous rant by someone who is due for his annual office Christmas party but would prefer to jump off a cliff instead. I did found one on the first page and even that didn't expand much on the subject but it grasped the meaning of not going to the party. The other search results in pages 1 and 2 strongly instruct you to go. I didn't bother with page three and beyond since I thought that if it's not on the first two pages, obviously someone's ranting about their upcoming office Christmas party wasn't deemed important by most google visitors, hence... I don't know. I'm sure it isn't the case that everyone is looking forward to that. Who is longing to see their collegues in various stages of sobriety by the end of the evening, raise glass with the man who had been berating them in front of a client only 4 days ago in order to make an impression to said client and generally spend as many as many as 7 hours that could be spent in valuable, personal time, with the people they see at least 40 hours a week, 48 weeks a year?</p>
<p>Most of these websites assume that you can turn up anytime you want "but not as soon as the party starts",  and that you can leave anytime you want "but stay at least two hours". None mentions what you could do differently in the case that a cab fleet has been called to pick up all the staff immediately after work, and another will do the same at the end of the evening (which is 1:30am) and everyone is expected to turn up for work at 9am the next day?</p>
<p>There's not much you can do there. As much as I hate office Christmas parties or any other work function that involves anything more than a swiftie at the local boozer, I believe that if you don't understand why you must go then you should submit your resignation on the spot. What you do there is your prerogative. Me, I normally glom on the people with whom I'm kind of familiar and that's it. You can text or phone people who aren't there all night long if you like. But go you must.</p>
<p>At some point I was texting a friend who wasn't there and telling her about my plight. She replied with "I don't go to office christmas parties cos I can't be bothered. I don't care what my colleagues think of me. I have bigger worries. If you don't want to come you don't have to provide a reason to your boss. It's none of their business. Sod them all and go home."</p>
<p>Fair enough. Don't you think? Why didn't I think of that myself? This would work out perfectly. Apart from the fact that even if attending office parties isn't part of your contracted duties, you still should go because it's part of your unofficial duties.  Yes, there are those too. Why are they not on your contract? Do you think you would take seriously your employment if your contract read something in the lines of:</p>
<p>1. To design and develop software applications<br />
2. To design and develop the back end database(s) to support the applications<br />
3. To thoroughly test and debug software applications designed and developed by the Company<br />
4. To maintain in-house software applications throughout their life cycle.<br />
5. To attend the Company's annual Christmas function where every employee is required to remain in the venue until 1:30am and resume duties in precisely 7.30 hours after the end of the function.</p>
<p>Perhaps clause 5 is not there because when I signed up we did Christmas lunches at the time. Yet, not even that is in my contract.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. However, you can do all those other things we mentioned. Even if you should go to the office Christmas party, there's no obligation on your part to talk to anyone and be animated and friendly. Do your thing and let them wonder why you don't mingle.</p>
<p>I'm a very miserable bastard at work, bordering on subhuman, some would say. At the office party, I was beastly even after a few Budweisers, which isn't like me. This has no correlation with the tone of my writings here. I'm definitely not grumpy - except for the times that I am - and I don't only find ills with the world - although I do find a huge lot of them. It's just that I and many others like me can't help but spot the ludicrous in situations that those non-afflicted regard as normal. We take amusement or irritation in things that seem to slip everyone else by. For example, when they tell us that with your "triple play" communications package you get a free digital tv decoder, but the "one-off set up fee" is £60 and their competitor does not have a set up fee but the monthly cost is a little bit higher. You see a pack of lamb loins with a big yellow sign that says "Buy one get one free" and you think that just one pack is already overpriced. You read on the paper "pregnant teen dies of swine flu" and wonder if anyone else reading this thought "two fewer chavs on benefit".</p>
<p>It is in that sense that my bed has two wrong sides. Of course, being that and a miserable bastard are not two mutually exclusive things.</p>
<p>In fact I tried, yes, I tried to have a little fun as well. Like try and hit on the boss's lovely secr... err... office manager. Just a bit of harmless flirting with no expected outcome. She is, after all, a co worker. Ok, maybe I pushed it a little too far, knowing that I won't be trying something like that with her until the next Christmas Party, if I go and if I'm still working in the same company, but I wasn't inclined to do anything serious, and she was even less so.</p>
<p>A few metres away there was a 50+ drunk bird who was rubbing some younger bloke's todger over his trousers. Just what one needs on a weeknight. But it was nice to see that she's still got it in her.</p>
<p>Next year, the company should pay us to go out to different parties seperately, on Friday night. Yeah, that's the ticket.</p>
