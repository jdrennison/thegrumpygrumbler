	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>I've not written in a while and it's probably going to be just as much time before my next post. But on Saturday I read something in a left-over copy of the Times and I thought I should contribute my two penneth. The article's title went something like this: People lose thousands of pounds in pension because they don't compare annuity providers. I'd like to help whoever has written the piece and whoever was interviewed in the process understand why we prefer to do better things with our time.</p>
<p>The article goes on to explain that customers don't do it because they're afraid they will become confused by the sheer  number of options they are given.</p>
<p>Er... no shit?</p>
<p>I generally consider myself to be a smart man with logical skills. It could take me a few hours or days if I'm not familiar with a market to compare prices but I always find what's best for me in the end. When it comes to pension plans? Not so much.</p>
<p>First off, like most people I didn't know what a pension plan is until I saw it mentioned on graduate job adverts and even that was a bit obscure: they just said that a pension plan is provided. Having become a bit savvy from the old country I suspected what turned out to be true in the end: state pension isn't good to buy a pack of chewing gums so someone thought: "awright, there's a gap in the market that is beckoning me to fill it" and there was the first pension plan.<br />
If you were given a graduate job offer and it didn't include a pension plan you probably went "fuck it, the work looks interesting and I need the money to pay off my student loan". It's too early in your life to think about retirement.</p>
<p>Then you come across a company that does offer a pension plan. You don't get to choose which insurance company to go with, your prospective employer has already signed a deal with one.</p>
<p>You accept the offer and you find yourself saving money for retirement before they get taxed, also your employer contributes. You can choose where you want to invest your money online.</p>
<p>Hang on. Why are you asking me to invest my money? I thought I'm just saving for retirement. "But if the money remains uninvested it won't keep up with inflation and its buying power will be less". In theory you could have £30000 in the bank and in 30 years time it could be worth £2000. Well wouldn't that be about a shit?</p>
<p>Alright I should invest my savings then. What are my options?</p>
<p>Well, you've got several. Property, equities, they all are high risk/high reward or a low risk/low reward. So you could lose money in the hopes of making more money for your retirement or earn enough money for your last years and leave some for your children too. There's never a low risk/high reward investment. You leave all of your hard earned cash in the hands of complete strangers which will either make it go away forever or give you back pretty much what you've put in or give you back a lot more than what you've put in. So the chance of you getting significantly more money than your investment is 1/3. Yes I know that nothing is guaranteed and its all about how much you are willing to bet. My point exactly. It's a gamble. Almost like a gamble that you are dragged into as the alternative is to live on the state peanuts.</p>
<p>The low risk/low reward of any given insurance company has a long unintelligible name.</p>
<p>Mind you we're not on the annuity provider comparison yet, we're still shuffling through shit given to us by one provider. Imagine trying to calculate the amount of annuities you want when comparing annuity providers.</p>
<p>The article mentions something about information overload. When you end up signing up with someone they send you shit-tons of "information packs" which has been called an "anti-consumer practice". There's no pleasing some people. Very little information - they're making stuff difficult to find and people give up. A lot of information, they're trying to fucking fry our fucking brains. I don't actually know if there is a group of middle aged people sitting in a room rubbing their hands with glee thinking "ok let's put that footnote in and try to disorient whoever reads this". But, well, have you tried to read one of the bloody things? I have and I wish I had read a book about nuclear physics instead. I would understand more and would find it a lot more useful in my progress in life.</p>
<p>However all is not lost. You can pay an independent financial adviser to make this decision for you. Since they spend at least 40 hours a week doing this and you only spend maybe 20 days in your entire life they may know better. I don't know how many holidays you've got each year but most of us have the national minimum of 20. Each of these days we have to treat as gold. Hell, even 25 days off which some companies do is too little. Every hour we get outside of work and commute is gold. And I want to spend half a day of my precious holidays not visiting financial advisers.</p>
<p>So yes, that we lose money by not giving a fuck about annuity providers is not news. You want to know what else we get confused about? Mobile deals. Internet. Travel insurance. Used cars. Mortgages. This last one is such a shit, I don't find it much different from annuities. I wouldn't know anything about finances and loans to save my life and even expert financiers (is that a word) get it wrong because it's a chaotic non-deterministic system that we didn't trust before the recession, we trust less now.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago there was another article about people not switching their broadband ADSL or Fibre optic provider. Just think about it. You live in London. You work at least 40 hours a week and only have the weekend to do your chores. If you had to spend your precious weekend comparing "deals" every time one of your contracts expired you wouldn't be left enough time to use the services they provide.</p>
<p>Would a Soviet style scononic model be better? Of course not. I lived in a country where for the first decades of my life we only had two state-controlled TV channels. Private phone and TV were unheard of until the early 2000s and households got theit first <strike>broadband</strike> ADSL lines around that time too after the sole state telecommunications provider would push back for 5 years because they weren't making enough money from their existing ISDN lines they had invested on in the previous years.</p>
<p>Then I came to the UK where it's easier to start a business and before you know ot there are tens of every service provider you can imagine. Then, to prevent an all-out war between them, their executives hold meetings behind closed doors agreeing to keep prices similar and split the consumer crowd.</p>

	    <p>I phoned up BT to talk about my broadband connection which was never activated. That wasn't the first time I called them for the same reason. The first time I tried they promised they'll let their order management department know about my siuation and someone will ring me on my mobile. Never happened. The second time, I got redirected to every conceivable BT department with many waiting intervals in between. 43 minutes after I dialed their number, my phone's battery died out and I had to leave for work. Which brings us to today.</p>
<p> I spent about 35 minutes hearing that they are sorry, but they "are very busy at the moment" and that my call will be answered "as soon as possible". At least they were decent enough to drop the "your call is important to us" bullshit. Because, clearly, if my call were important to them, they would have hired more staff to keep the call queue shorter. I considered the ringback option for a moment (if the call queue is too long, you can select the ringback option and they say they'll call you back within a hour), but I remembered two occassions a few years ago when I did so and no one deigned to ring me back. So I decided to wait.</p>
<p> So, 35 minutes on, a rather peeved third worlder said something that I didn't clearly understand, not least because I had the phone on speaker and was caught a bit off guard partly because of it, and partly because I thought the sales department was based in the UK.  After much deliberation and many intermissions folllowed by "thank you for staying on the line" - like I have much of a choice - he said that a manager would call me on my mobile within 48 hours. Thinking that the previous case was an one-off, I agreed but I decided to take a shot and ask him what exactly the problem with my line was.</p>
<p> "It's fairly technical and even if I could spend an hour explaining it to you, you still wouldn't understand," the third worlder snaps.</p>
<p> I'll tell you why I didn't snap back "Mate, I work in IT and telecoms so you can take  a shot if you like". First off, you do want to be on the good book of a bunch of third worlders who know where you live. Second, imagine being confined in a chair with space as much as that of an economy class airplane seat somewhere in Bangalore and have a middle class twat half a planet away shouting abuse at you. Third, I believe that most of these people genuinely want to help but they are allowed/have the capability to do only so much.</p>
<p> That happened a week ago and no one called me back.</p>
<p> I dreaded going with TalkTalk or Tiscali or whatever the bloody hell it's called these days, Bulldog, if it hasn't yet gone bust or any of the other small providers as I would trust all of them combined just as I would trust a cat next to my hamster uncaged. With BT I still had a chance since I've been with them three times and have never had problems with them. Granted, their broadband speed is fucking slow but unless I was willing to pay Sky's exorbitant "one-off set up fees" and a TV package I don't need, BT was the next best thing. In fact, there was an article in the paper last December titled "UK broadband slower than Greece". You just know that things are utterly fucked when you hear something like that. Every time I visit family I am surprised by the fast speed a video stream is buffered from the web. The fastest broadband I've had here was with Sky and you can still tell the difference.</p>
<p> "Which are your favourite TV shows sir?"</p>
<p> This is a question I would expect on a first date and not by someone at a call centre. I knew where this was going but I answered regardless. "Yeah, I watch 24, FlashForward... that sort of thing. What is it to you?"</p>
<p> "I'd like to inform you of an offer we have on BT Vision this month only."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not interested."</p>
<p> "May I ask why you're not interested?"</p>
<p> "Oh that's rich. I've already ordered a service from you that isn't working but at least the telly will work and you want my money off that, is that it? There is a very specific reason why I called you guys. If I wanted TV I would have ordered a box already, but obviously this is not the case."</p>
<p> I don't know why I've even bothered. I presume most of these call centre workers get picked off the street and only know how to deal with textbook problems so I normally go easy on them. But this one was fair game. He got even more peeved when I declined his offer and asked me for a reason and I showed great restraint so as not to say anything bad about his country of origin. But in any case I never forget that I'm dealing with a person. A person that none the less at the time of their shift represents a huge cumbersome being that you cannot take on and judging by the horror stories I've read on teh interwebs it will many times play hard to get. Unless you cancel your direct debit and make them chase you for their money. When the Indian told me that someone'll call me within 48 hours and that didn't happen then I knew that they could no longer play me like that. I called them on me day off on Friday when I knew that most people would be at work and I would get through to someone quickly.</p>
<p> Bottom line: I got a new activation date for my broadband. If I don't get it, there's the High Complaints department. Then it's Oftel. Or Ofcom. Or whatever the bloody hell they're called these days.</p>
