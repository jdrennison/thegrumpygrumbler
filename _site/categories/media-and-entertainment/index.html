	  </header>
	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>For the most part, I like Cracked. Sure it's an American humour site and a lot of things on it don't apply to British everyday life but that aside, it provides a lot of lessons in life from people who have been through stuff and seen things.</p>
<div></div>
<p>I've also heard they pay you money to write for them. What the fuck, I thought to myself, I've been doing this blog for five years and it wouldn't hurt to make £63.8092 for submitting a draft. And, if it gets approved by the editors, become a published article and be seen by millions. A few more of these, then move on to a bigger medium, get famous and wallow in £50 notes and pussy.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Seriously. People have done less for the prospect of money and minge.</p>
<div></div>
<p>I decided to look into this further and read into the process. Here's what it looks like, and has put me off.</p>
<div></div>
<h3>1. The article needs to be in the form of a "listicle".</h3>
<p>This is in the FAQ and they're saying that listicles work for them and they got more views since they adopted a "listicle-mostly" policy. But listicles are the articles of the lazy reader, surely? Cracked is the go-to place to be entertained and, of late, educated. You're not supposed to read their articles thinking "so I've read the 5 'horrifying' realities of being a dog hairdresser and they didn't shock me. I hope the other three will". This isn't Buzzfeed or Upworthy. It's, or should be, way more substantial. Do they think people will think "tmfl; dmfr" when they read the things that you do every day without realising makes you a bad person?</p>
<div></div>
<p><em>"So let's see... how many paragraphs remain until the end of item 2? I hope there isn't much left, I'm getting off in two stops, maybe I'll manage to squeeze in number 1. Hang on, what does it say here? There's an unspoken rule that w</em><em>hoever has power over someone else must keep to themselves or they will be forever hated? But we're near the end of the item #2? Why</em> <em>isn't the author expanding on that? Fuck, that's my stop right here. I'll save the damn article for later along with the other advice articles that I've hoarded and will never read, but this one I will read. Why? Because even if it wasn't a "listicle" Cracked writers know how to retain your fucking interest, that's why.</em></p>
<div></div>
<h3>2. They want you to do research</h3>
<p>That's a first. But how about this: I'm not going to research fucking anything. I'd do research for a university paper but this is a comedy site and editors can and do write opinion articles. Apparently they want third parties to do some educational pieces as these take the bulk of the hard work that is required when writing an article from Cracked. That leaves more time for the seasoned staff to write more opinion-based articles while we run around interviewing people and reading journals to present our findings in a comedy-style narrative. In the marketing circles this is known as crowdsourcing which roughly translates as "the people inside an organisation experiment with all the interesting stuff that doesn't generate enough revenue to keep the organization afloat but they get outsiders to do the tedious shit which, however, brings more money to the organization, and give them a tiny cut from the revenue". My argument here is that the most revenue-generating sources are, like I said, tedious shit.</p>
<h3>3.Research isn't required if you have a personal experience that is deemed unique.</h3>
<p>If you've been through stuff that most people haven't, Cracked would like to hear from you. Over the past couple of years we've read on the site stories from someone who've <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_21858_what-its-like-to-survive-point-blank-blast-from-shotgun.html">accidentally shot themselves and as a result got amputated</a>, a woman who was a <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_21538_5-things-i-learned-as-sex-slave-in-modern-america.html">victim of people trafficking</a>, <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20841_5-things-i-learned-as-cop-that-movies-wont-show-you.html">the story of a cop</a> and the account of a retired Delta Force operator who was hunting and interrogating Taliban commanders in the Kush during the peak of the War On Terror. Ok, the last one has never been featured but, who the bloody hell knows, just give it a year and see.</p>
<p>I won't fit into this category either unless they let me write an article called "5 things I've learnt being a software developer in London whose life has pretty much been home-work-home-bar-on-Saturday-night".</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Cracked does take itself too seriously, but, hey, it'd be a good way to make money and get laid like a fucking motherfucker.</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>Yesterday I watched Avatar in 3D. This isn't a movie review. I just want to write a few words about the 3D "experience".</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned time and again, those of us who grumble at the slightest distaste of anything aren't necessarily miserable and "down" all the time. Quite the contrary. It's just that we are very sensitive to anything that doesn't feel right.</p>
<p>So when a young woman started addressing us before the start of the movie, I just thought "Really now, how hard is it to watch a movie? What's so different about this one that some busybody in the board of directors has decided that we need instructions?" She went on to tell us that mobile phones are prohibited in the theatre. That's very comforting. I don't really know if IMAX employs bouncers but I'd love to see what'll happen if a phone rings one day. It will probably just cause the dismay of other viewers.</p>
<p>The usher then goes on to tell us not to put on our 3D glasses and that there will be an automated message telling us to do so. She didn't tell us if it's prohibited to do so before we hear the automated message. I love it when they treat us all like invalids. I'm sure everybody who can afford to go to the pictures with £15 has enough of a mental clarity to tell if the projection in front of them is 3D or not. At least the bloke behind me said that the trailer that was shown immediately afterwards was not 3D, although it was shown after the proverbial automated message.</p>
<p>The actual 3D was indeed impressive. It seemed like Sam Worthington was a few metres in front of me. Last time I had seen something like that with people in it was in a 3D cinema in Trocadero in '98. They only had the resources to produce a 20-min movie back then, with almost non-existent plot and solely focusing on the 3D impression. Yet apart from this and some scenes where they were trying really hard with the plantation, the rest of the picture seemed quite flat, really. I think that technology's still got a little way to go. And it would be nice if we didn't need glasses too. It's a particular pain in the bollocks (or the clitoris) for those who already have their own. I must have tried for about half an hour until I found a position that is comfy for the nose and the glasses keep away from my own glasses' lenses. Wouldn't you know it, the darn things tend to get scratched when they're weeks past the warranty.</p>
<p>Might I now mention that Stephen Lang is the man.</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>It has come to my attention that a cousin of mine has appeared on Greece's Got Talent and there's a relevant clip on YouTube to attest to that.</p>
<p>They say you should be able to choose your friends but not your relatives. To protect his privacy, no, scrap that, to protect MY privacy rather, I won't publish a link to the YouTube video. I can see his point though; he's a productive age yet lives on the dole and has too much free time to piss about and obviously he got paid to appear on the episode he did. When I was shown the vid with his act, I just knew; I can think up a hundred ways to waste my time but to see a clip of my cousin on Greece's got Talent will actually make me want to invent time travel and reclaim 2 minutes of my life.</p>
<p>The "judges" there are cut from the same cloth as Simon Cowell et al. Talentless yet lucky enough to ascend to showbiz, on the brains department they're no different than the general population and obviously they took a couple of risks in order to get money and fame which turned out to their advantage. Their replacement is standing on the stage before them, longing for their approval.</p>
<p>I won't go on on how talents got discovered before the talent show era. That goes without saying. What I don't understand is why one would make a complete motherfucking cunt out of oneself to prove a point or, for that matter to pass one's time. It's one thing to be judged by examiners on how well you have studied a profession, in which case you can appreciate their judgement and perhaps take no for an answer. On top of that, the examiners will not take the piss on you like Simon Cowell does.</p>
<p>"Quit fucking watching it then", I hear you say. Fair enough. Might I mention that I haven't, in fact, seen one single episode of any of that. That doesn't mean you've just escaped it, no. A member of your family or a friend or an acquintance will be obsessed with it and talk about it. I've had two guys in their mid-30s telling me how gracious Susan Boyle was and that how everybody who judged her by her looks should be ashamed of themselves and oh I was one of those too and I'm so full of regrets now. In short, a type of conversation one would expect only from our girlfriends when they were away from us in a shopping mall while we were focused on the important business at hand, i.e. getting pissed up at the pub at 2pm.</p>
<p>In the recent years we men have been politically corrected like nobody's business. In a sane world, Billy Elliot would have gone to his dad begging him to register him for boxing classes. Britain's Got Talent would be aired on a 4th class cable channel. There would be a variant of Sex And The City with men. See where I'm going with this?</p>

	    <p>I haven't yet found the nerve to tell my mates in Greece to fuck off next time they send me a chain mail of what is perceived as a joke. At the moment I am just content with just deleting the gits without looking inside. Yesterday, however, I received an e-mail with a URL starting with 'http://news.bbc...' on the subject line.</p>
<p>It must be important, I thought. Perhaps Anthony is watching what's going on in this country as the "politicians" are wrecking it and he wanted to bring my attention to something I may have already seen but sometimes you just don't know.</p>
<p>"Taking showers can make you ill", the title read, and the article body went on explaining that your shower head contains "dangerous bacteria" and they make their way to your skin when you take a shower.</p>
<p>That's right. The Bacterial Shower Head is coming to sit next to the Bacterial Keyboard in the Bacterial Hall Of Fame. You remember that one? Yes, it's the keyboard that is n times dirtier than a public unflushed shitter (where n &gt; 2). What was your reaction when you first heard that? Very few people would, I presume, rush off to shed alcohol on their keyboard. Most likely, the reaction of the rest would have been "Fuck them scaremongers".</p>
<p>There is no denying that keyboards accumulate germs, but so does a mobile phone's keypad, a train/bus support railing, a steering wheel, money, keys, especially if you drop them on the ground or the floor. Everybody can deduct that simple truth. And what do we do about it. Jack shit, of course. Me, I can't be arsed. And in any case none of the people I know will ever take off their shower head and immerse it in bleach dissolved in water on a monthly basis.</p>

	    <p>As I was doing my grocery shopping, those strategically placed colourful magazines caught my eye. Although, honestly, even if they weren't so strategically placed, they could still be spotted from anywhere in the shop being so bright that in the event of a blackout they could easily light up the place. </p>
<p> Imagine being a grocery store clerk and you are restocking the place: "Hey Ngozi, we need to put the latest version of "Heat" next to the till queue area. These old hags who shop here have a memory that fails with age, so let put those mags there to be sure to sell them." </p>
<p> Anyway, there was a big caption in one of them that read something in the lines of "Pete speaks his mind and tells all".  First of all, they assume we all know who "Pete" is. I wouldn't know, if it weren't for his wife (is she still his wife?) whose cleavage stars frequently in the covers of said magazines. I didn't even know that he's a singer. Before I found out, he had only earned the attribute of "the famous guy who has married the glamour model with the big tits". Basically defining him through his famous wife. Pretty much in the same manner as how we came to identify Sharon Osbourne's husband ever since he stopped recording anything of essence. </p>
<p> Basically, it's not a bad thing, having the world know that you shag a glamour model with big tits. Yes, she may be a total airhead. She may be an avowed chav. Yet, it's not a bad thing for one single reason alone. </p>
<p> As the late Don LaFontaine would say, in a world where you're judged by how handsome you are, how much you earn and how pretty is the chick you bonk, you could be the scourge of humanity, an untalented bastard. That means jack shit. Yet you get the big-titted glamour model and become the envy of the male population? All these millions of peasants settle for what they can get while the hottest of the hottest will only look at the likes of pop  singers. That's why they have their faces in the magazines. To remind you where you stand in the social chain and where they do. The personality and how decent the character of their partners are, are not important. They have money and fame and 70% of the world population is looking up to them. </p>
<p> You would think that I'm jealous. For one thing, I know i would never become a pop singer or a model or a footballer. I do the job I think I can do better than any other. Singing is something I'd like to do as a hobby but I don't think it's exactly a rational career to be a pop star or a glamour model so, I've left these two out. What bothers me is exactly the fact that i work just as hard as a performer on european tour, yet I earn 6 times less than he/she does. Of course, I'm not as expendable as they are nor do I have to deal with the circuit of their industries, but still. </p>
<p> The other thing is the wife. How many non-famous men out there can honestly claim that if they could be with virtually any woman that they desire, they would choose to stay with their existing partner? Do we conciously choose the best woman while turning down far better looking women while they would fall hell over heels for us or do we settle for what we can get? </p>
<p> Anyway, those magazines follow the lives of people we don't know and care and who will never get to know what we do in our lives. Yet I suppose they sell a lot of copies. There are two cases at play here. Both apply to those who settle for whatever they can get. 1)They see famous people and their beutiful wives/handsome husbands and live the life they're not living by following what they do. 2) They read their breakup stories nodding their head thinking 'tsk tsk, he got married to a chav glamour model with big tits and silicone lips, what did he expect, did he really think he would keep her or what? At least I'm with my below-average-looking wife who is down to earth, but come to think about it I'd like to do Katie at least once'. </p>
