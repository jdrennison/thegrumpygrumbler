    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>For some time now I've been working in a large office environment. I did some contracting work for another client once so I had had a bit of exposure in such a setting before, but never until now had I really pondered as to how things work in one.</p>
<p>Without further ado...</p>
<p><strong>1. Team work</strong><br />
Bigger companies are more organised than startups, which means that if you are a lower level employee in your department, there is a lot of other yous to spread the work on and leave for home just a bit after but as close to 5 pm as possible. I'd worked at a startup where it was headphones-on for 10 continuous hours, each developer working on a different project. Nowadays the same work is done by an agile team of three or four. There needs to be constant communication between the team members and between the team and the business. We enjoy a pint or two after work but more on this later.</p>
<p><strong>2. No one implements anything fully</strong><br />
I'm sure it happens in every trade but I'll talk about IT. Agile. Scrum. Test-Driven Development. Outside-in Development. Forget what they ask you in job interviews. Have you ever done a sprint retrospective AND a sprint review at the end of each sprint in all of the settings you've practiced Scrum? Do you sprint each time you add features? Do you write no more production code until you have all of the unit test code that will cover it? These techniques/principles are there to help us deliver functionality to the business but some of it is "forgotten" as we program that functionality. You know this. Your interviewer knows this. It's definitely a better way to develop software rather than the old "we've got to get the motherfucking thing out of the door yesterday" management style by people in startups who haven't taken a single management course. I've personally never known of a company that does Outside-in development. Yes, by all means you can do what you want with your home projects which have no delivery date by which your market commitments start. At work, it's different. A bit like the impression you get after three interviews where you think you'll be joining The Mother Of All TDD Practices and on your first days in it's all "we should really automate that build" or "we've finally found some time to retrofit the last two releases with unit and integration tests, would you mind helping Team X with writing some?"</p>
<p><strong>3. The office hot babe</strong><br />
It's the one you wish your wife or girlfriend was hot as. She knows it and acts like it. She shakes more than an earthquake when she walks. There's no way she hasn't got a boyfriend. There's also no way of knowing how the hell he got into her pants through all the competition although you can take a pretty good guess. Most likely she's a receptionist or a PR manager or a special assistant to a very, very senior executive.</p>
<p>Yes, by all means look but avoid prolonged stares. Do you want the whole office to see you staring at her arse? Is it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>4. Office parties: You don't have to go.</strong><br />
In a startup you would attend a shared office party. Non-attendance would mean that a noticeable 10% of the workforce would not show. "Fuck off, I can't be arsed" is not an acceptable reason not to go to that Christmas party. Just see it as paid overtime.</p>
<p>Not so in large companies. You have the option of non-attendance. Simply don't RSVP (or whatever the fuck it's called) when you receive the invitation e-mail. They'll all have better things to do at the party than see if you've come.</p>
<p>First off, the beer is free and after a few you may have a slip of the tongue, if you're getting my drift. Second of all, though you may like everyone in your office, you're already spending at least 40 hours a week with people most of which you wouldn't naturally be friends with. Do you want to see more of these people in your free evenings? Sure have a pint or two with your team if you have to but then go back to your friends. That's how I see it. To each his own I guess. I think I speak for most developers when I say that we didn't get into this line of work because we like people. We prefer the deterministic behaviour of the machines we program and not the hassle of unpredictable interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p><strong>5. Not just you, no one else knows bloody anything</strong><br />
Ok, most of us get the gist of what we've come here to do. As you get to know people who work in more "serious" positions, you get to realize that they're just acting it up and are unsure of what exactly is expected of them. They like you to think they've got a good handle of things but all they're doing is making a quasi-good attempt at hiding that they don't. Unlike in the Old Country, most people here have a BA or BSc in something completely unrelated. Quite often, what you're assessed on day in and day out is demonstrating that you know how to take orders, work hard and suggest departmental strategies. But be careful: do it only up to a point, preferably when your input is allowed and don't rock the boat. If there are situations no one likes to change but drive you up a wall, it's time to dust off that CV. In a job interview you should say that you've practiced Scrum and TDD and have proposed and implemented certain alterations in the way the department delivers functionality, which took productivity to skyrocketing levels, although for all you know you and everyone else have been sitting at your desks typing things into a computer.</p>
