  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>We've seen what lot of good our past and current leaders have done us. If I get enough page views I intend to cash them in and consequently rule this dirty little planet. I think my manifest can be drawn up by excerpts of previous articles but I'd like to mention some things that are gonna change around 'ere once I'm in charge. 'Cos some people currently in charge are just taking the piss, it seems.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is I've found solutions to all of world's problems and while I was searching for them I still had the time to drop by the pub. I'm presenting a few right here.</p>
<h3>A cap will be imposed on airline tickets</h3>
<p>We do like to fly often here in Blighty. Heathrow is one of the world's best connected airports.</p>
<p>The airlines know this and it looks to me that their sole purpose is to take the piss. Watching the airline fares going up and down is like watching the fucking stock market, for fuck's sake. You monitor price fluctuations for the dates you want to fly on to save a few tens of pounds. If you're flexible with your dates it means it's the airlines' decision when you're going on holiday, not yours.</p>
<p>This won't longer be the case once this measure is brutally enforced. It will now be your decision when you want to go to a place with decent weather. No longer will you have to choose between sacrificing one of your 20 days off a year or an extra £150 to get the privilege of going away for a bank holiday weekend. Of course, there will still be supply and demand or, rather, supply. If a destination isn't popular at this time of the year airlines will be allowed to drop their prices but if becomes popular then can rise the prices again but only up to the price cap. This will be dependent on the destination and reviewed every year.</p>
<p>Because fuck me if I have to plan my trip one year in advance just not to pay £500 just to get crammed in a metal construct and emerge elsewhere just 3 hours later.</p>
<h3>Food shopping from high street sandwich shops will become easier</h3>
<p>In a further move to a bigger government, I will simplify the rigmarole of buying a sandwich. Sandwich chains, you know who you are but like I said before, the last thing I want right now is to see my face on a rag because someone decided to get offended. But really there aren't that many chains who don't just take your money and give you a receipt but decide to brutally interrogate you before you can walk away with your lunch. Now that I'm not the benevolent dictator of Earth, I can print out some T-shirts that will read:</p>
<p>Take away<br /> I don't want anything else<br /> I haven't got a loyalty card and I don't want one<br /> I want the receipt</p>
<p>When I was a child, then a teen and later a young adult, the process of getting a sandwich was a very simple one. You'd take a sandwich to the till, you'd give a bank note, you'd get change and then leave the store. This would happen in a small, independent shop. In more corporate chains, they'd only ask you if you want anything else to which you'd answer "no, thanks" and not "If I wanted 'anything else' don't you think I would have fucking asked for it instead of waiting for you to ask me?" because they only follow corporate policy. The people in the front line of the service sector have got enough shit to deal with without some idiotic wanker being smart. Just smile and say "no, thank you" to everything they ask. I remember I was sitting at a restaurant and the waitress who was serving me was what I think looked like six months pregnant. If you can't imagine yourself being horrible to her because it took her more than 30 seconds to bring you the bill, why would you do it to others?</p>
<p>I know about suggestive selling, I used to serve coffee and confectionery myself back in the day. Your server simply follows the business's imperatives and, mark my words, they are spot-checked.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-688" src="/assets/home-server-icon.png" width="256" height="256" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">And if they're don't ask to sell more things they're taken offline.</p>
<h3>Voluntary sterilizations</h3>
<p>In order to raise the average IQ of humanity I figured I had to reduce the procreation of certain types. My earliest measures will include sterilization clinics around the world. Anyone can drop in and have their tubes tied or whatever the fuck it's called in the case of men.</p>
<p>Clearly you wouldn't expect someone to just drop in and get sterlized, right? Me neither. Consequently I decided to add some incentives to attract different crowds. I could simply force them off their homes but may I reiterate that I want to be a <em>benevolent</em> authority figure, not a tyrant.</p>
<p>So, depending on the target group, gifts will be thrown in to entice it, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ticket to the X-Factor Live finals.</li>
<li>The discographies of Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Cheryl Cole and One Direction at the time of operation.</li>
<li>A set of weights and protein powder.</li>
<li>A bicycle and a fluorescent jerkin that reads "one less car".</li>
<li>A subscription to the local tanning salon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we're saved for good.</p>
<h3>Listening to music over a certain volume on public transport will be outlawed as a felony</h3>
<p>At least those wearing headphones and setting the volume to max are <i>somewhat</i> justified. It could be they've become hard-uh-hearin' after having done this for too long. But the wankers that use a mini speaker have absolutely no excuse and it's not worth getting stabbed in the lung for telling them to turn down the volume. They <em>all</em> look like the stabby type.</p>
<p>This wouldn't have been a problem if there were laws in place for such a thing. The first time someone does this will be let off with a warning. The second time will have their music playing device and knives confiscated.</p>
<h3>Centuries will be numbered by the first two digits of the years they contain</h3>
<p>So 1950 will be in the 19th century and not the 20th century. Honestly, I've never understood why we can't do this very simple thing. Every time I'm mentioning a historical event I must make calculations in my head as if I'm calculating Tokyo time. So, 1950, that's the twentieth... no, obviously, it's the nineteenth... oh fuck it.</p>
<p>Not any more. From now on 2014 will be in the twentieth century. Same goes for the turn of centuries. If you went to school or graduated by the late 90s you probably had had a debate with someone about when the millennium really ends. The rationale went like this: since there is no year 0, year 1 to 10 would be one full decade, so the next decade would start on 1-1-11. The "twentieth" century started on 1-1-1901 and ended on 31-1-2000. The current millenium started on 1-1-2001. I know, it's kind of fucked up. If I had invented the calendar this oversight obviously wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>Upon my takeover, I'll introduce year zero and century zero. When invented, the concept of zero was hailed as one of the major turnpoints in science. We're also doing it in programming.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-688" src="/assets/home-server-icon.png" width="256" height="256" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">This is a legacy platform that will take us a lot of money to replace. And change the habits of a lifetime.</p>
<p>That's my position for my next election campaign. I'm also open to suggestions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Technology has penetrated every aspect of our lives. Just to take the internet as a sole example, in the twenty years that we've had it as we know it, life has changed radically.</p>
<p>So at this time and age surely you'd think someone would have built something that just bloody works? 'Cos most of the things I've seen or used don't.</p>
<p>WordPress editor - extra lines appearing intermittently out of nowhere and you can only remove them if you go to plain text view and press backspace or delete over whitespace.<br />
Smartphone - it's got ridiculously slow over the past few months and I had to disable most apps that came with the phone without me asking for them just to give it some extra speed. I also had to manually clear the cache of every working app as the internal RAM was still in critical mass.<br />
Camera - Battery only lasts a couple of outings. Maybe an outing and a half if I make heavier use of it. Also the battery icon only has three indications: Full, One Bar Down and Blinking Red: About To Shut Off.</p>
<p>In fact the only things I've seen have worked consistently as per factory specs for the years I've had them are my mini vacuum cleaner and my stubble trimmer.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-649 size-full" src="/assets/trimmer.jpg" alt="Trimmer" width="212" height="128" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">There's actually a set of larger blades that comes with it. I use it to shave my bollocks.</p>
<p>So nice work, us! It only took us fifty fucking years to make a vacuum cleaner and a razor blade work as they should.</p>
<p>In the 50s they told our parents that by 2000 we'll be commuting to work via jet capsules that will be travelling inside tubes that will be sprawling across the city. I remember this envisioned future being told to us by teachers and media In the 80s even, although the "by" year was shifted a bit forward. To this day we've not seen super-tall buildings, spiralling carriageways that go up in the sky and robot taxi drivers.</p>
<p>Yeah, what happened to those, I wonder? You'd think robots would be capable enough these days to ask you your destination, drive you somewhere and then ask for the fare or get out of the car and chase you at superhuman speed should you attempt a runner.</p>
<p>Robots do become more complicated but they're not yet ready for a real end-user application. This is how the history of robotics can be summed up, as this was demonstrated in various university research facilities around the world:<br />
1980: Robot walks on flat surface and avoids obstacles.<br />
1990: Robot walks on a flat surface and avoids obstacles but it's made up of more complicated parts.<br />
2000: Robot walks on a flat surface and avoids obstacles but it's made up of even more complicated parts.<br />
2010: Robot that looks incredibly like a Japanese woman if you watch a video of it in 144p, walks like the robots of the past three decades, raises its hands like a robot of the past three decades and blinks.</p>
<p>The same goes for the web. The internet's scope hasn't changed in the last 15 years, said scope being to search for information, shop and have a wank, but today it's done with large beasts that are programmed in two or more languages. Websites tend to behave as an interactive desktop application. Instead of keeping the same stateless HTTP that drives the whole web and dance around it with cookies and hidden HTML fields and what have you, why can't we upgrade the protocol to allow duplex connection and phase out the existing HTTP? As if this were not all, some companies are treating some web standards as guidelines only and that leaves us poor sods having to code around their non-compliance to those standards.</p>
<p>Recently, Google held a "keynote" presenting its new products. From an end user's perspective they're just the same as the old products only a bit fancier with fancier animations and they're planning to put Android into more things, including wristwatches that can read notifications from your phone. Because, really, that's what was missing from the world. Google finally responded to the deluge of user feedback desperately asking to have a wristwatch that can show a fraction of what an Android phone does, at the price of three watches that can't do that.</p>
<p>What do you mean they had not had such feedback?</p>
<p>Most people who own an expensive smartphone use it in the same manner as they used to use an expensive smartphone before it was called a smartphone: call people, send texts and plan your day with the built-in calendar and task list. Only now they can do it on a 24-month contract. Would any of them go back to a Sony Ericsson K-800? No. Someone told us these old phones are no longer cool and trendy and you need those new touch screen ones with the faster processor and the better animations. I want to show my new S-fucking-5 to my peers, the K-800i is so 2008. And this is in fact where technology has gone wrong. It's become a fashionable thing and has been left to the marketing cocks of business outfits to decide what new gadget we get to see next but if there's one thing for sure it's that at the very least they shove the successor of last year's model down our throats every year. Unless you have £500 to spend on a new fucking "smart"-phone every year you'll probably be replacing it less often but since marketing cocks have convinced you that they seem like they're ten-a-penny, if you drop it and it breaks you'll probably think "well, it's been 13 months, time for a new one anyway. Also a 2014 phone looks more like a 2014 phone as opposed to the 2013 model I bought last year." Silly? Well, evidently it works.</p>
<p>The same goes for us on the producing side of technology. You learn a new way to create a web application that just Creates/Reads/Updates/Deletes records from a database. When you've got a good grasp of it, bam, it's different. Not only did it work before they changed it, it also worked well. Now it's working well but it may have more bugs in it. As far as the end user is concerned unless there's new functionality in an application or significant visual changes they couldn't give a rat's left bollock how it works under the bonnet.</p>
<p>Before you shove all kinds of useless bells and whistles into something, make sure whatever's already there works. Before you put a 12MP camera into the latest phone, it'd help if you kept the 8MP cameras they have right where they are but fix them so they can take non-grainy photos even if we're not pointing them directly at the sun. Compact cameras; same thing. Give us better image quality without noise. I don't know anyone who uses the smile detection feature. Also, the ISO 3200 mode in most, if not all, compact cameras produce photos which are shit but hey let's include an ISO6400 one! But then again the sales department would have a hard time to sell a non-inclusion of new bells and whistles.</p>
<blockquote><p>" We don't have enough time to fix things <em>and</em> add new things before our cut-off release deadline date so in our new flagship model coming out this year we thought we should have existing functionality work better instead of adding anything new. Well, surely the processor is new but we don't make them ourselves anyway. If you have our previous model you surely have noticed that if you take photos in any lighting conditions other than an exploding nuclear bomb you're hard-pressed to tell what those grains in the photo are supposed to make up. So now the camera will produce good photos in sunny and overcast days too and we didn't add extra megapixels. Also we increased the battery life so your new phone can go for over 12 hours without recharging by sticking in a bigger battery and making the phone the size of a brick."</p>
<p>- Advert on new features</p></blockquote>
<p>This loop we've fallen into is perfectly summed up in a cartoon I saw somewhere a few weeks ago where a guy plays a new racing game in his console and his girlfriend says "This looks like like the game you were playing last year" and the boyfriend goes "no that one was Drive Fast 4. This is Drive fast 5." The girlfriend then says something like "so you're racing other cars in Drive Fast 5 just like you did in Drive Fast 4. What's the difference?" and the boyfriend goes "but can't you see the pixel shading in this new one?"</p>
<p>This is a vicious cycle in which our standards are low and corporations don't bother releasing anything above them. Because they don't make anything radical, we become accustomed to and take what they give us without giving much thought to what greatness could be invented.</p>
<p>But no one ever listens to me so you just get what's coming to you really.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>When we hear that someone has taken their own life we wonder who it was and that when all is said and done none of us is long for this world, really.</p>
<p>Sometimes instead of the above, we think "fucking hell, I'll miss dinner now". This is when a suicide takes place on a train track on which thousands of passengers will be travelling at peak time. Someone had the audacity to jump in front of a moving train when the rest of us have had an exhausting day and we only have a couple of hours to eat something, talk to the family and then go to bed.</p>
<p>If you think that we are insensitive for thinking that, clearly you don't live in London. And if you do, you probably haven't been living here for long and/or your job is very easy. The kind robots will be doing soon (This isn't mine. I don't know who said that). Listen how it goes for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a cat. A small, fluffy cute pet that provides you with companionship. You like the sight of it and you like stroking its back while you're watching telly, when it's home and not busy banging other cats or chasing mice.</p>
<p>One day you get back home and in the sofa there are two cats, yours and a friend of his. You discover there is no chip implant on its neck so you can't trace the owner. It's fluffy like yours and you think yours can do with a bit of company and since cats are highly independent and they'll be spending much time in the back garden you decide to keep the new cat.</p>
<p>A few days later you come back home to see the place infested with cats. So many cats in fact that you watch your step to not step on one's tail. There are cats on the telly, the sofa, the kitchen the shower, the bedroom. You find all of your decorative chinas shattered on the floor as well as all of the dishes you had placed on the dish dryer the night before. Your curtains have been ripped up and all of your furniture has scratches. In that case it may cross your mind that cats in numbers may be more of a pestilence than companionship.</p>
<p>That's what happens in big cities. I think there's far, far too many humans living in such a small space and we all know what happens to a product's value when the market is swamped with that product. We're pestilence that's racing to outnumber locusts. You see thousands of people every day on the way to work and on the way back. That's why we don't make eye contact with anyone as we enter the train. We don't acknowledge them. None of these strangers means anything to us and we think this city would be a better place to live with a 30% reduction in population. When we hear about a (corporate speak incoming) "fatality on the tracks" and it was an accident we think that were there fewer people in the platform this poor sod wouldn't have tripped over and fallen into the tracks. If it was a suicide... how would you feel if one of the tens of cats that suddenly infested your house decided to stick its paws into a wall socket and end it all? Would you curl in sorrow and wonder what its name was?</p>
<p>I've written about suicide during rush our <a title="Will I get home" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/will-i-get-home/">before</a> but in the past few weeks on two separate occasions I tried to hit on two girls who recently moved to London from the "North" and couldn't believe how desensitised we Londoners are in the face of human tragedy. I told them exactly what you read in the previous paragraphs, if you bothered to look. Did I get laid? You will never know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A few weeks ago I was in a software developer event and one of the speakers gave a talk about communication and understanding among the software development community. In it, he spoke about rules of conduct and how any remarks that refer to, among other things, physical appearance are not ok. You could make a comment that seems perfectly fine to you but soneone upon hearing it could feel ignored, excluded, marginalised. As an example he told us about back in the day when he was working in a team where someone said something that caused another team member on the "large" side some discomfort. The guy on the "large" side (large as in "fat", not as in "tall") later on kind of withdrew from the social interactions with the rest of the team and in the end he would only talk to them when he absolutely had to.</p>
<p>What happened during that eventful meeting? Did someone approach the fat bloke and called him a "fat fuck" to his face? Did he say something about "fat people"? No. Their team was developing a custom suggestive dictionary software for touch screen devices and someone said that with all the mistakes we make typing with our "fat fingers" this application would take off easily.</p>
<p>That's right. The absurdity of this was made fun of in "The Thin Blue Line", where Rowan Atkinson's character jokingly says "The pot called the kettle African American". Just how are we supposed to know what offends whom these days?</p>
<p>In the post about <a title="Everyone was looking away and no one stepped in to help" href="https://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/why-wouldnt-anyone-help/">Fiona Mountford's tube incident</a> I could be called a sexist and that I'm suggesting that if a woman gets treated like that she might have struck the first blow (I wasn't there, she might have).</p>
<p>In the post about <a title="Starfleet officer: “Data is a thing”. Twitter erupts." href="https://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/starfleet-officer-data-is-a-thing-twitter-erupts/">a Starfleet officer being accused of speciesism on Twitter</a>, I could be called an insensitive white heterosexual middle class man who mocks whoever becomes indignant over any racist, sexist, classist or speciecist thing that happens to go through their Twitter feed.</p>
<p>One time we had some issues with a software that wouldn't do certain things in some languages and therefore caused problems for people who spoke those languages. As I was investigating this, my product manager went "fucking foreign languages... why can't everyone just speak English". I just nodded and said "in any case, there are languages other than English and we have to support them". I didn't say "I can't believe you just said that". I didn't feel  ignored, excluded, marginalised.</p>
<p>I wonder how what reception a talk of mine about communication and respect would have had if it ended like this: "We are a community and we have rules of conduct. Any comments about race, religion, sexual orientation and physical appearance are in breach of these rules. Of course if a person on the large size is offended by expressions such as 'fat chance' it's their fault for being such sensitive pussies and if they haven't got a metabolism problem it will not be seen as a breach of the rules of conduct to ask them to reduct their frequent trips to McDonald's and go do some exercise. We're here to create great software and not pussyfoot around words in case someone decides to feel offended for the day. If I say 'big arse method' should I get down on my knees and apologise to people on the large side who just happened to be within earshot? Fuck that."</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I took advantage of the national holiday that was and headed for the beach.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-557" src="/assets/beach1.jpg" alt="British Beach" width="676" height="492" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">Well, whatever passes for a beach here, that is.</p>
<p>My first order of business was to get to know the town I just found myself in so I took one of the open decked tour buses that seem to be in every city and town in the world. After all, what's a better way to see a new place than have a local tour guide show you around? Then you'll have more time in your hands to have a stroll in the same high street as in your own town, with the same chain coffee shops, the same chain restaurants, the same chain bookstores, when high streets had bookstores. When food replicators like those in Star Trek are made there won't be any coffee shops and restaurants in the high street either. I'm pretty sure that the only thing that would survive are the pubs.</p>
<p>But I digress. Going back to the tour bus, the thing was parked in the town centre and the tour guide was singing something loudly along the lines of "The best way to see the town and the surrounding areas is by our open top tour bus, you'll spend two unforgettable hours on the tour bus"... you get the idea. "I'd like one adult ticket", I tell him. In case he mistook me for a toddler or an elderly man, of course. Then he taps me on the shoulder and says "get on board and we'll come find you, my friend".</p>
<p>He... tapped me on the shoulder and called me "my friend". This is how the people of the countryside differ from those living in London. In London, the longest conversation you would have with a stranger is when you slightly brush them on the tube, say "sorry" without looking at them in the eye and continue on your merry way. Except on a Saturday night that instead of "sorry" the other person <em>will</em> look at you in the eye and say "oi, you got a problem, bruv?".</p>
<p>During the bus tour, the weather went from sunny to cloudy and then overcast and rain. As I got off the bus he, the guide, said "you just know the weather will be bad when there's a bank holiday". The surprise didn't come right away. Firstly, the reminder sank in that on 6 out of 8 public holidays in the year the weather is utter shit. Then there was the suprise. Hang on, what just happened, I thought to myself. He, the guide, a complete stranger to me, was making small talk? He was chatting to me about the weather and that bank holidays like to bring it down on us. I looked at him as though he'd offered to fill my water bottle with some of his piss.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, you have the fewest public holidays in Europe but remember that at least you have public paid holidays. Now you also want clear skies with them? It's all take, take, take with you lot.</p>
<p>- The Man</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me digress once more, because I like to do so. "Bank" holidays. They call them that because banks are closed during that time and therefore do not handle money. If they don't handle money, no other business can work as the bank is the middleperson (P.C. for middleman) in every transaction. So it's the bank's holiday first and everyone else's second, by consequence. If you wanted to know who really runs the place, you didn't have to experience a financial recession to find out. You needn't have seen the media get all worked up about bankers getting bonuses that's twenty times your salary. The name Bank Holiday is indication enough.</p>
<p>So, weather talk. Typically at this time of the year you can't predict the bloody thing. I was wearing a t-shirt, a shirt and a thin denim jacket. Sometimes it was too warm and I had to take off the jacket. The next minute it was too cold. I am normally not bothered by this as I normally look out of the window in the morning to decide what to wear and if the sky is relatively blue I go "fuck it, short sleeve and the leather jacket it is". I can handle the walk to the tube station/bus stop, weather conditions don't affect me when I'm commuting and there's heat or air conditioning in the office. When I go out, only the venue changes. But it's a wholly different story if I'm travelling lightly for a few days in the spring and I'm out and about all the time. Wear a warm jacket and you'll sweat your bollocks off when the sun comes out. Wear a thin denim jacket and your bollocks will freeze when the sun hides behind a cloud layer or when it's overcast. What I've found that works is to get a backpack with clothes that cover each eventuality but you'll have to be carrying with you always since there's a high likelihood you'll need any and all of the packed garments within an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Nightlife</strong></p>
<p>The night is in full swing and on Friday and Saturday some pubs are allowed to trade for longer than during the rest of the week. Great news! So instead of getting kicked out at 11 you're allowed to stay and drink until midnight. If you wwant to carry on drinking you'll have to go to a club.</p>
<p>I've not seen many differences from London, really, apart from the fact that these places must be full of locals every week. You would think you can't afford to get in a brawl as those you were playing "let's punch each other in the bollocks" with the night before you'll see in a restaurant next week when you take out a first date. Just like in London, everything has a bouncer outside because presumably no one can go and enjoy a few beers without getting into a fight with someone. In fact I've seen it so often that I'm now paraphrasing Arthur Clarke's third law:</p>
<p><em>Any sufficiently advanced number of late night drunken incidents is indistinguishable from premeditated attempts to commit violence on behalf of the general populace.</em></p>
<p>So I'm now pretty sure that lots of people before they go out they think "whoa, what a fucking week that was, I just can't wait to go drink six beers and then punch in the teeth the first unlucky sod I cross paths with".</p>
<p>Other sights include long queues to get into a cheap bar and get cheap shots.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-590 " src="/assets/club-queue-e1401923024928.jpg?w=204" alt="Club Queue" width="300" height="441" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">I've queued for far too long to be turned away by you fluorescent jerkin twats. Here's my ID.</p>
<p>I saw lots of girls that would have done everyone a favour if they either stayed at home or inform us where they're going to be spending the night so we won't be going there. And because these days everyone likes to share the innards of their souls on the Internet, I am offering to write an app that aggregates women's status updates about where they're going when they're going out. To be featured in the data aggregation, the woman must have a sufficiently large Kitsch Index, which will be determined by whether she has selfies on her Facebook and Instagram and how much she looks like white trash. Then the data will be displayed on a layered Google Maps map where you can see the trends of the evening.</p>
<p>Seriously. What we see in any given evening cannot be unseen and if our retinas could speak they would beg us "please, no more!" after the repeated rapings they have suffered.</p>
<p><strong>Fancy dress without being out on a hen night.</strong></p>
<p>If I don't see any ribbons around their torso I just assume they're not celebrating their girlfriend entering married life. Instead, I always assume they had thought "girls, what are we doing tomorrow evening? I say we snag some used PVC nurse uniforms from the dustbins outside the Brazzers studio and hit the town!" Nobody finds it sexy or cute. If men are looking at you it's because they're thinking "what attention fucking slappers they are". Seriously, I've never seen anyone busting a move on women wearing fancy dresses at a club.</p>
<p>Moving on. Barefoot fat chick holding her £10 shoes from Missbehaving in her hand. Not sexy. Give it up. Well we're partially responsible for that too. You see, someone like her will always find someone eager to find just another hole to shove his rod through, no matter whether he is in a relationship or not and chances are it won't even be as good. Hugh Grant used to do Liz Hurley and yet elected to mess around with an ugly prostitute. If Hugh Grant did that, imagine the lengths that you'd go to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-605" src="/assets/mainssocket.png" alt="Mains Socket" width="255" height="272" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">Tell me you wouldn't smash that.</p>
