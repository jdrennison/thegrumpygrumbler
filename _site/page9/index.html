  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Did you know that 11 hour work days are bad for your heart? I've just found out. Someone was reading a free paper on the train and the page he was on had that article. Curious, I searched it on google. The article is pretty much the same in all of the search results. 6000 British workers were "studied" and although there was no definitive proof that working long hours cause coronary heart disease, there is a "clear link". That's a bit like saying although there is no direct proof that going to the local news agent at 10am will cause you to get stabbed by a robber, there is a clear link between going to buy beer late at night and get stabbed. Although they do admit that if you get a heart attack it "may" be related to the pressure you get from work, the same pressure you feel when you feel compelled to work 11 hours a day.</p>
<p>So here's something that we didn't know thus far. Being stressed at work can be bad for your heart. It can also be bad for your personal life and your marriage but for some reason these two don't seem matter much for the papers whenever they feature an article about overtime.</p>
<p>On an average week I work 60 - 65 hours and I get paid for 40. I don't like it but I doubt it's any different in most software companies unless you work in GooglePlex where, as we keep being told, it's fucking awesome. The point I'm trying to make is that before that heart problem that you may or may not develop sometime in your career, you will lose other things, earlier.</p>
<p>Well I suppose if we bring this to our boss's attention that'll fix things, eh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Yesterday I watched Avatar in 3D. This isn't a movie review. I just want to write a few words about the 3D "experience".</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned time and again, those of us who grumble at the slightest distaste of anything aren't necessarily miserable and "down" all the time. Quite the contrary. It's just that we are very sensitive to anything that doesn't feel right.</p>
<p>So when a young woman started addressing us before the start of the movie, I just thought "Really now, how hard is it to watch a movie? What's so different about this one that some busybody in the board of directors has decided that we need instructions?" She went on to tell us that mobile phones are prohibited in the theatre. That's very comforting. I don't really know if IMAX employs bouncers but I'd love to see what'll happen if a phone rings one day. It will probably just cause the dismay of other viewers.</p>
<p>The usher then goes on to tell us not to put on our 3D glasses and that there will be an automated message telling us to do so. She didn't tell us if it's prohibited to do so before we hear the automated message. I love it when they treat us all like invalids. I'm sure everybody who can afford to go to the pictures with Â£15 has enough of a mental clarity to tell if the projection in front of them is 3D or not. At least the bloke behind me said that the trailer that was shown immediately afterwards was not 3D, although it was shown after the proverbial automated message.</p>
<p>The actual 3D was indeed impressive. It seemed like Sam Worthington was a few metres in front of me. Last time I had seen something like that with people in it was in a 3D cinema in Trocadero in '98. They only had the resources to produce a 20-min movie back then, with almost non-existent plot and solely focusing on the 3D impression. Yet apart from this and some scenes where they were trying really hard with the plantation, the rest of the picture seemed quite flat, really. I think that technology's still got a little way to go. And it would be nice if we didn't need glasses too. It's a particular pain in the bollocks (or the clitoris) for those who already have their own. I must have tried for about half an hour until I found a position that is comfy for the nose and the glasses keep away from my own glasses' lenses. Wouldn't you know it, the darn things tend to get scratched when they're weeks past the warranty.</p>
<p>Might I now mention that Stephen Lang is the man.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I've never been to Washington, D.C. Modern Warfare 2 was the tip on the iceberg in a series of many stimulis that are making me want to go and visit.</p>
<p>By that I mean that I had once placed my visit to Washington in a vague date between 2007 and 2015 but now I'm reconsidering thinking that if I'm to go and see it I'd better be quick because it's in for big trouble.</p>
<p>In Modern Warfare 2 it's invaded by Russian ground forces. Most of its landmarks are decimated.</p>
<p>In H.A.W.X. it's invaded by a private military contractor's fleet of fighter and bomber jets.</p>
<p>In Fallout 3 it's been destroyed by a nuclear attack. I know at least that ICBMs tend to do a lot of damage but most of DC's landmarks are still standing. I suppose how else would the gamer know which city they're in?</p>
<p>In World in Conflict, it's leveled by a nuke. Properly leveled this time. Landmarks inclusive.</p>
<p>In Dead Zone, Johnny Smith sees an apocalyptic version of the future where a nuclear bomb falls on Washington in retaliation for the Americans' launch.</p>
<p>In Seven Days, a disgruntled former serviceman nukes DC.</p>
<p>In Transfer of Power and Season 7 of 24, the White House is taken over by terrorists.</p>
<p>And recently, in The Pursuit of Honour, DC is rocked by multiple terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Of course, Fallout 3 isn't remotely plausible. The idea of a future devastated America occupied by mutant humanoids makes for a good fiction story nobody believes it will ever happen except for guys who live in their mum's basement. Global war and terrorist scenarios, though, are another story. Of course, London is also attacked in fiction, but mostly by aliens or deadly plagues, both scenarios far fetched.</p>
<p>So what's with Washington?</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Since when do we feel guilty for taking holiday? Since when? Isn't it our union-given right to have holidays and forget about work? Yet any holiday that is more than two days makes you feel you're not attending to somebody's money making desire. Someone is not making money while you're on a beach, so don't go on the beach.</p>
<p>When you do manage to go away for a while assuming that your colleagues will take care of your affairs anyway they can, you dread that phone call from the office administrator. "Uh yeah, sorry to bother you on your holiday, but Sue is having a problem with 3000 end users who aren't receiving the e-mails with the code to activate their user accounts. Can you find a wi-fi connection in the hotel you're in and fix it ay-sap please?" Which would be, I suppose, fine if the company were mine. But it isn't, hence the lack of motivation. Assuming my company can launch several products on time and rake it in, I won't be receiving another penny, save the expected and well deserved yearly pay-rise. So where is the motive? Yet, off the top of my head I have two counter-motives. One, I have two people that will bollock me if I make a mistake. So counter-motive one is that I don't want to be hassled. Counter-motive number two is the fear of losing my job. But as we all know that will only make one work just hard enough not to get fired. And will get just enough of a pay rise not to quit.</p>
<p>Anyway this was going to be an entry about this weekend. Thursday was the day of departure. At the train station, I asked for a latte with one brown sugar and as the barista was making it, I realised I had had no cash. That wasn't really the problem as everyone accepts cards at this time and age. The lack of display of a card machine kind of troubled me, though, so I asked the barista if they accepted cards and she said no.</p>
<p>"Rightâ¦ I haven't got cash, you see", I said to her.</p>
<p>"Is that so? I've just made your coffee, so what am I going to do with it now?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about that. I assumed that you have a card machine since pretty much every other coffee shop in the world does these days."Â  Except in Greece and probably in the third world shitter you're coming from, is what I omitted to tell her.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, we don't. Ok, fine, don't worry about it."</p>
<p>"I'm not worried. I haven't paid for the drink so it's not my problem."</p>
<p>That was mean but I pretty much get like that at 6:30am.</p>
<p>I arrived at Gatwick and went to the check-in desk. You've read this here before; those questions they ask you when you hand in your luggage, yet it never gets old. There is a loud voice inside me urging me to make a joke. I just have to do it some day. "Yes, a bearded Asiatic man gave me a metallic canister with a green LED on. He was also watching my luggage when I went to get a latte from the nearby Costa. He mentioned to me something about fireworks in the sky but I'm assuming there's a festival here somewhere which he's going to attend." The other one I fancy is "My aunt gave me a birthday present for my cousin who lives in London. I haven't seen the inside of it but my aunt is a devout Christian so there's nothing to worry about now, is it". Then I envision the continuation: sixteen men with bulletproof vests and wielded sub machine guns closing in on me, so I leave it.</p>
<p>There were queues in every shop, even in the toilets. I think it was the first time in my life I had to queue to take a shit. As if this were not all, there were no coat hangers in the toilets either so I had to leave my rucksack on the floor. Don't worry though, the toilet room was reasonably big so I left it next to the door.</p>
<p>I'm still tempted to turn on my mobile phone in flight or use my MP3 player during take off and landing. A advanced aircraft with a state-of-the art nav system couldn't possibly be interfered with when you listen to H.E.A.T.'s new CD, eh? Noâ¦ but who will make the first step and prove this is so?</p>
<p>Upon my return to Gatwick, the pilot said that we mustn't use any electronic devicesÂ until the aircrafe comes to a halt and the doors are open, or they would interfere with the aircraft's system. Yeah. The pilot will crash the aircraft into the jet bridge if you're impatient to check your texts.</p>
<p>Thing is, there is no scientific proof that "electronic devices" "interfere" with an aircraft's systems. It's all about reminding us who the fuck wears the pants in the relationship lest some of us forget.</p>
