  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Funny how I keep noticing more things that are wrong about air travel every time I visit the airport.</p>
<p>The one good thing about traveling mid-October is that most people don't take holiday. You can get past the check-in and security quickly and the queues at the duty-free are very small. I still haven't got my head around the sports cars that dominate the middle of the departure lounge and taunt me. So, that was the timeline up to getting into the aircraft. The real fun begins next.</p>
<p>I've said time and again that the whole no electronic devices on the aircraft business has no basis whatsoever. Yes, they do let you use them when the plane has completed the take-off phase but do they ever tell you when that take-off phase is complete? Do they fuck. I normally wait until the plane feels level and maybe a couple of people have got off their seats and opened the overhead compartments. That's my cue to turn on my netbook, MP3 player and what have you.</p>
<p>Do you remember back in 2004-2005 when mobile phones with a flight safety mode was a new thing? Airlines didn't mention anything about not using mobile phones "during take-off and landing even if they are set to flight safety mode". I was wondering how the person sitting across the isle from me would react if he saw me playing with my phone which was one of the few models at the time that had had a flight safety mode at all. Nobody had acted cranky, though. You would think that at least those who take their fucking sprogs with them on the plane would make some noise about me cutting short the life of their little shithead kids.</p>
<p>Before take-off they announce that even if you’re a frequent flyer it's recommended that you watch the safety demonstration. Like safety standards have changed at all in the past 2 months since I took my last foreign holiday. The security standards, however, have indeed changed in the past 9 years and we've yet to watch a security demonstration by the cabin crew. I'm especially interested in knowing the most expedient way of wrestling to the floor someone you hear scream "Allahu Akbar".  If he is far, will someone closer to him tackle him? If not, will I have a chance of diving in his direction before he detonates or is that as aspiring as <a href="https://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2009/10/02/pre-plane-crash-behaviour/">fulfilling my objective with a fuck-target moments before a crash</a>?</p>

    <p>I don't know Pat Condell in person but he's exhibited a certain level of stuck-up-cuntness throughout his YouTube career. Yet, I've yet to disagree with anything of what he has ever said in his videos.</p>
<p>His latest one - "An Irish Joke".</p>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmxMlSTETo]</p>
<p>I wonder what he'd have to say about the "<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7918782/We-sell-big-knockers-ad-banned.html">We sell big knockers</a>" advert. If you can't be bothered to click on the link, let me give you the rundown: A door and window company's advert featured a topless woman with the caption "We sell big knockers". A woman got, yes, that's right, offended and the advert was pulled out. Before we even got to see the fucking thing, would you believe.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There were two chav girls on the train yesterday morning one of them yelling on the phone about the barbeque she went to the night before.</p>
<p>Then a lady in her early fifties told her off.</p>
<p>The chav girl hung up and said "It's only you who is moaning, no one else".</p>
<p>"I'm sure a lot of other people feel that way but are too polite to speak up"</p>
<p>Me, on the other hand, while I agree that a lot of other people, myself included, feel that way, they would much rather stay quiet than risk physical confrontation with someone who could carry a blade for all they know. Granted, it was 8:30 am, the two chavs were not intoxicated and didn't look belligerent, but really and truly there's only one way to find out whether they would assault you. And this isn't a place where someone who's not wearing a uniform will come to your aid. So at least the middle-aged woman did test the waters and kind of gave me the green light to show how polite I can be to a chav that I know won't retaliate. Of course, it's not exactly a demonstration of leadership to tread when another has, so I let it slide. The chav promptly got up, followed by her friend, and mumble that she can't be pestered like she's some twelve year old. True. But she can surely be pestered like she's got "pestilence" written across her forehead.</p>
<p>Pros of telling off a chav: they'll think twice before doing it to other passengers in the future because someone is showing them they won't take it. Cons: you can be killed or permanently crippled or your career can be destroyed for killing them and going to prison. Really now, is it worth getting life and having to tell your family that you ended up in prison because someone made you mad? Think about it. Whether the departed was an inbred fuck who would never contribute positively to society doesn't mean much to the court.</p>
<p>So basically I and the rest of the passengers in the carriage chose the right course of action.</p>

    <p>Is it a coincidence that every time someone goes out on a shooting rampage everyone afterwards say "I can't believe that a person like him would do such a thing. He was always kind to everyone."</p>
<p>When will someone say "The bloody bastard was a murderer waiting to happen. Deep down he was a twat. I didn't believe he was actually going to do it but there it happened."</p>

    <p>No matter how fast you rush to a cash mashine, there will always someone that will beat you to it when you need money.</p>
<p>Corollary: the time taken for the person in front of you to withdraw cash is directly proportionate to how quickly you want to withdraw cash.</p>
