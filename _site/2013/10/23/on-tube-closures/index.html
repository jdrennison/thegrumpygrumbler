      <p>Over the years I and many other Londoners have been inconvenienced by tube closures during the weekends, except the summer of 2012 when it also happened that very few of us actually cared to use it.</p>
<p>When commuting to work it sometimes breaks down. When you want to go out and pull someone, they close whole sections.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_344" align="alignnone" width="802"]<img class=" wp-image-344 " title="Tube closures" alt="Planned engineering works for the weekend. Everything will be closed. We thought to rally the troops and fix a bit of everything. Really, why do you want to go out this weekend anyway? People will be fighting everywhere and you may get caught in the middle. Also, we know and you know there's no chance of you getting hooked so there's that too. Whatever, just wait until we're done." src="/assets/tube4.jpg" width="802" height="535" /> It took me more time to find a good tube map photo than think up the punchlines and add them to it.[/caption]</p>
<p>They say the works will take <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18072.aspx">as much as 10 years</a> to complete. It's already been going on for 10 years, so it'll be 20 years when it's all done. With the advancements in engineering and technology the bits they did first will be pretty much old by the time the projected end-of-engineering-works date will arrive. But I guess as long as they're not the "break-down" type of old, everyone will be fine with it.</p>
<p>Realistically, if there's one thing that will give the Tube more than the estimated 30% capacity, that would be cutting wider tunnels and have wider trains running in them. The cost of it is prohibiting and if they were to go ahead with it they'd close parts of the tube for months or years on end. Instead, they're solving the problems of today and 80 years down the road the tube will need yet more "improvement works" and they'll be closing parts of it again until 2120.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18072.aspx#qu1">A very good FAQ section on the TFL website.</a> One of the things that will be different is that there will be air-conditioned trains when it's all done. Still no mention of being able to use a mobile phone. Last time the train came on top I remember I was so elated to get a signal to access the internet, I thought I was going to die if I couldn't read my feeds for another 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Also, no mention of any plans to deal with drunk fucks on Saturdays.</p>
