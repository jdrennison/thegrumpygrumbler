      <p style="text-align:justify;">One of the complaints we hear from our users is that the software we ship to then should "just work".  They shouldn't anticipate a potential bug every other week and if they do we should be able to respond to it immediately.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This should indeed be the case. The software we make is supposed to "just work". After all, this is what you would expect from the manufacturer of your car, isn't it?. You should be able to trust your car and not be afraid that something will fall off the engine when you do 70 on the motorway. Ok, there needs to be some common sense of your part as in drive at the correct speeds for the gear the car is on and also have it serviced after a certain number of kilometres but other than that you would expect it to just be a black box and give you what you need.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-288" alt="Image" src="/assets/id-100113546.jpg?w=390" /></div>
<p style="font-size:.7em;text-align:center;">Image by anankkml / FreeDigitalPhotos.net</p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">"Could a dev look into the blown engine issue as a matter of urgency and push a fix to production asap please."</p>
<div></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, every software has bugs. Every time I see the words "known issues" on the readme of a piece of software I download I think that if I do this and I click that, will the whole thing bomb out? If the dev who wrote this knows this what's he doing right now? Is he working to fix it as we speak or is he thinking "fuck it, I've told my customer base what the fuck will happen when you do this and that so I'll fix it maybe next week"?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"We will not ship shit", said <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/09/06/I-am-Your-New-CTO.html">someone</a>. "No amount of management yelling will ever make us ship shit." That would be nice wouldn't it? We should say no every time we think we can't deliver something in the time frames we're proposed and give honest estimates instead. And always do it right. It doesn't matter if we don't ship all the features</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet, we seem to think that bugs are a natural part of the software life cycle. "There will always be bugs" is what I've lost count hearing. I'd like to meet the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">man</span> person who's come up with that directive. What we dislike most about our job isn't the testing. It's the bug fixing. It's the investigating in order to find out why the fuck something isn't working right and whether whoever wrote it was daydreaming of beaches and fit birds at the time.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" alt="" src="/assets/id-10086002.jpg" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.7em;">Image by imagerymajestic / FreeDigitalPhotos.net</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">Not to worry, they'll get the new guy to fix that 500 error they see on every page.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I've concluded that there are three reasons why we ship shit.</p>
<h5 style="text-align:justify;">Software development is a creative process</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We get user stories and requirements from the business. We architect the software and materialize those stories in code. If we need clarification we go back to the business and ask for it. I'd rather not have to do this (see reason No. 2 below) but just get everything at once and the requirements be clear. If the customer changes their mind, I'd like to know about it and get the whole story again without the need to ask for clarification. I will think "wouldn't it be better if they had fucking made up their minds when the requirements first came in" but I won't say a word because the customer is always right and pays for my lifestyle.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" id="i-288" alt="Image" src="/assets/sp_wow.jpg" /></div>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">No, this is now behind me. No, really, it is.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The "problem" comes from this: software development is a creative process. It's an art. I equate myself with the street artist that paints your portrait while you feel your muscles hurt while trying to hold still. Imagine telling the painter this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">"We need to get the ears out first. What's your estimate for the ears? Let's prioritize this and then the nose. How hard is it to make that? 5 story points?"</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image" alt="" src="/assets/portrait.png" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">There's your portrait mate, now off ye fuck.</p>
<p>No matter how hard we try to stick to requirements and use cases and worse case scenarios, there is always room for misinterpretation. Irrespective of how clear an idea you think your have about how your software needs to work, there are ten ways of doing the same thing. There are differences of opinion and perspective. Due to the novelty of each project there is always some amount of uncertainty with respect to its execution. Most of the time and only while you're down to the code, you will think of a use case or an edge scenario that hadn't come up in the meetings. The product managers won't know the answer to that and not even the client will; they will have to think some shit up and you'll have to wait until said shit comes down the chain. This, I call work disruption, a culprit for introducing bugs as we're juggling with multiple logical aspects in our short term memory while some exec didn't think every possible outcome of how the fucking thing should do its job. And this won't happen only once or twice a week.</p>
<h5>We don't like to push back</h5>
<p>We're tech people, not exactly renowned for our people skills. Some of us are downright socially inept. In the Gaussian distribution of software developers those would sit on one end. On the other end are those with good people skills, usually get sick and tired of coding and ever-changing technologies and eventually  become managers. The rest of us struggle to keep up with ever-changing methodologies and technologies until... well I don't know. I've not seen many old programmers around and I doubt they all become managers.</p>
<p>Well, my point is that when we smell conflict on the horizon we do our best to avoid it like the motherfucking plague. "Can you do this feature in two days", asks your project manager with a look that says "You better say fucking yes to that". No. I can't. If I say it'll take four days it'll take four days. I will explain to my best of my abilities why it could take so long but if the reason is that I'm new to this project or platform or the company or that the existing code base looks like the spaghetti I had last night that caused me to do a shit three times between the morning and the afternoon, I'll keep this to myself. At least this is what we should do. Instead we reluctantly agree and some of us even go as far as to say "I'll try" which is code for "Fuck off, it's four days and if you don't like it, tough shit mate".</p>
<p>We are hired to say "no". It won't make us heroes. Yet, we are the technical authority. The project manager, savvy as he* may be, could be more accurate in an estimate. As in, if he has worked with other devs who know a project better than you, he might call you out on this. "But seriously this should take far less". Should it bollocks. You do the work, you provide the estimate and this is the estimate he should hold you to. If he doesn't like it he can get another dev to do the work and you can work on that exciting greenfield project that never seem to be taking off.</p>
<h5>Some of us don't think this is as important as making cars.</h5>
<p>Cars have to be robust and as a non-car mechanic, non-car maker you just have to bestow trust upon it to get you from A to B without killing you and I don't know about you but I don't remember incidents of deaths by car failure - if the car is new or well-maintained.</p>
<p>When a bug needs to be fixed "urgently", you might think "what's the urgency? Does a person die every minute I spend not fixing this?". Unless you work in the healthcare sector, no one will die if your software has a bug. So the most likely case is that for every minute you haven't pushed a fix to production someone is losing hundreds or thousands of pounds per minute. "Money is different, no one dies". Maybe so. Because like the rest of us you live in a non-capitalist economy and money doesn't move the world. No need to worry yourself sick if lives don't depend on your software but if someone tells you to fix something you fucking fix it.</p>
<p>Then find which monkey coded this piece of shit and make sure he doesn't live to see another day for making you stay late... oh it was you six months ago wasn't it.</p>
<p>So this notion of "fuck it, software will always have bugs", I cannot accept. As professionals we have to always strive to improve software quality. In the private sector there's pressure to get out new features and get them out fast. And we don't like to push back because we are tech people and we like talking to computers more than talking to people. Because computers are deterministic and non-unpredictable. Unless the software they run on has bugs.</p>
