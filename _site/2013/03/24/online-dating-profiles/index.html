      <p>It’s a good thing that online dating has lost the stigma it used to have. You can see really attractive, successful women putting up a profile and see it as just another medium to meet men.</p>
<p>I got back into it recently ‘cos why not; I’m a busy man. I’ve got no hobbies or interests of any kind as I spend all my time outside of work by studying and learning new technologies, so there’s no time to meet girls. Bars don’t impress me, they’re not my scene. Besides, what’s the use of going out to those crowded, sweaty, loud, overpriced places if I don’t get to get laid? I mean, come the fuck on! If I wanted to go out just to enjoy myself and have fun, I could go on a country walk but we have spring for that. Though the last memo I got says spring is postponed this year.</p>
<p>So I was browsing through some profiles today and fell into one that belongs to an admittedly drop dead gorgeous female person. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi boys, I have tried many other dating sites but non of the few people that made it onto a date could make it onto a second date... I don't think I'm choosy at all, I just haven't met my fantasy man yet :) . I do have a very specific type, I like 6ft 2 and over with blonde/light brown hair and blue/green eyes who dresses smart-ish and works in an office and has at least a masters degree... That's really it!!! If that's you or even if that's not you but you know someone for me, please get in touch with me and I will send you the deepest prayers from me to find yourself a hot lady... You would be sent to heaven for having helped a 3 years of single ( and at the edge of desperation) girl and would also help your potentially my type fellow mates who are being or might be pestered by me :) ... It's time I get all tamed down and tied up onto a chair and taught some manners and posessed by a big, giant, macho man, I've been let free in the wild for too long...</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok honesty is a quality that most people appreciate, right? So how many hits would this girl’s profile get? I’m sure it’s got a few, after all many of us men (would you please stop calling us ‘males’, thanks) don’t think twice when we see a pretty face. She wants someone tall, Nordic and to have a flashy job (probably forgotten to add in that he should drive an Aston Martin) which is her prerogative, of course, but somehow I doubt that a man who worked hard to get all that would go for someone that is on the edge of desperation and was “out in the wild for too long” and has rejected guy after guy because they don’t have a Doctorate in something. Well, maybe some such men would take her for the aforementioned reason but then she will become their problem. But really she should have mentioned what she has to offer back other than the fact that she happened to be born with good looks. After all you ladies wouldn’t read twice a man’s profile that said “I’m looking for a blonde with big tits who likes threesomes with other girls and leaves me alone when I want to watch the footy”.</p>
<p>Only if you add “and did I mention that I own one of the three Lamborghini Venenos that will ever be produced?” at the end might you have a chance at it.</p>
<p>Here’s my take on online dating profiles. If the above girl can get away with this Paris Hilton-y narrative, meaning she can get past manual moderation, how well would you do if you tried to sound your worst? If you do get any dates, maybe you have to ask yourself why someone would like to date someone sounding like the below. Remember that this is sales and you’re looking to reach out to potential customers. We’re not suggesting you become dishonest but unless you’re the perfect man with no issues you will have to whitewash your online dating presence a bit. Everyone exaggerates a bit. I’ve got savvy enough about these things to read between the lines. So don’t feel guilty doing this whitewash.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>First take:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Really, do I have to do this shit?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I've tried some other dating sites in the past as well as going to speed dating and lock and key parties but so far the girls I have chatted to are either:</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Stuck up bitches</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Nice but want nothing to do with me</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Nice and fancy me but have fallen off the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Yes, superficial, I know, but so are you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I won't waste my time reading your weird, rambling nonsense in your personal statement. If I like you in your photos, I'll contact you or respond to you. Superficial for sure, but then again who isn't, so don't you get sanctimonious with me. Don't dress scantily; don't show your tramp stamps. Nobody likes a slut unless it's a fling (see below). It will cost me less to get a hooker for the evening. With respect to your likes and dislikes just make sure you hate sports, is all. I like the occasional swim in the pool but I haven't been to it for several months now and there's no chance of going more than once every other week. My other interest includes staying at home and beating the meat or playing Call of Duty. This is an expensive town and I'm knackered to go out after work, also can't be arsed commuting on the weekends. I work 60 hours a week and I can only do my chores on the weekends which doesn’t leave me with much free time. I've also got an old car sitting on my bay most of the week and I only use it to do my weekly grocery shopping but sometimes I like to go for a quiet drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I'm not really actively looking for a relationship. Chicks are mad and don't know what the fuck they want no matter how convincingly they say they do. However, if you're into a non-strings fun evening by all means do drop by. Maybe then I’ll prove to all those twerps that yes, you actually can meet someone sitting at home on your computer all day. Oh, and on your way in can you drop by Tesco's and get me a ten-pack of Stellas and two twenty Marlboro lights. I’ll pay for the pizza. Thanks.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Body: Fat</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Smoking: Hell yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Drinking: Hell yeah</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Star sign: What does this have to do with anything?</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Has Children: None. That I know of.</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Wants Children: No, fuck them kids, it's all about me and you, lovely.</span></p>
<p>Honesty is obviously a good thing but being less honest is different from being dis-honest. Let’s see If we can do better.</p>
<p><strong>Revision 1:</strong><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Well, I don't know what to write here but here goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I've tried some other dating services in the past but nothing quite cut it for me, so I'm making yet another attempt.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">What I'm looking in you is that obviously you have to be good looking but also have a good personality, like the indoors and the outdoors the same. Looking for someone sweet and less of a "party girl". I'm not a very sporty person but I enjoy my swimming and always make time for it through my busy work schedule. Other interests include going for a quiet drive to the country, I enjoy going out but sometimes I just want to stay at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I don’t know exactly what Ms Right will be like but if it happens, it happens. Let’s meet up and see whether we “click” together or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Body: A little bit overweight</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Smoking: Occasionally</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Drinking: Socially</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Star sign: (your star sign here or just pick one at random)</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Has Children: No</span><br />
<span style="color:#000080;">Wants Children: Maybe (let’s get her out there now and see how we break the news shortly afterwards).</span></p>
<p>Don’t think that this will land you any (dateable) girls either. It’s reeking with clichés.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Well, I don't know what to write here but here goes.”</p>
<p>Well, shit, we’re all winging it with this thing, man. We know you can’t be arsed but think about it as a job interview. It’s not going away anytime soon and you have to sit it if you want the goods. Actually remind me that I should write a post about job interviews sometime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I've tried some other dating services in the past but nothing quite cut it for me, so I'm making yet another attempt.”</p>
<p>And when she reads this she’ll think “the bloke just trolls through dating services just in case he gets something, stay away, stay away.” This time you’re not saying why your previous attempts were failures but you’re leaving it to her imagination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What I'm looking in you is that obviously you have to be good looking but also have a good personality, like the indoors and the outdoors the same.”</p>
<p>Ah, the old “I like going out but also staying at home watching a movie” thing. By that you can capture the attention of a sporty or a quiet one. Don’t even try; she knows you’re grasping at straws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t know exactly what Ms Right will be like but if it happens, it happens. Let’s meet up and see whether we “click” together or not.”</p>
<p>None of us knows what the special someone will be like and when we will meet them unless our parents have decided this by arranging or forcing our marriage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good job whitewashing the whole wanking thing and also that you visit the gym whenever you can be arsed.</p>
<p>About the key-value pairs: You should really keep those sincere. I’ve never seen a girl’s profile that she says she drinks and smokes like fuck, except for the girl at the beginning of our story. Seriously, where have all the smokers and drinkers gone? If you drink four bottles of Jack and ten pints of Fosters every week and you’re looking to cut down or you’re thinking about quitting smoking then maybe you could choose “occasional/socially” on both. I don’t know. As for the children, well, we’ve reached the age at which people are thinking about it. Just be honest. You don’t think you’ll sway her to your direction on something as important as this, do you? Will you waste her time before you finally break out the news? By the way, if she doesn’t want kids and you do, it doesn’t mean there’s something inherently wrong with her. Let her go. And before you do that, pass on my email address to her.</p>
<p><strong>Revision 2</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">Hey. I’ve arrived at this site looking to expand my avenues to meet you as life is busy as we are all. I work in IT and though I no longer do long hours, I’ve got to a point where my free time is often sucked into studying and learning new technologies, but this is the path that I’ve chosen in life!</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">I like driving across the countryside, going to the swimming pool and socialising with my mates. Sometimes I just want to stay in and I do just that. With the reading and practicing material that waits around that’s never actually a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;">You should know that I’m very difficult and picky when it comes to dating but once we’ve been out once, maybe we're on the right track.</span></p>
<p>Say whatever you want in the key-value pair section, but be sincere about the children stuff. Nobody reads the other shit anyway.</p>
<p>Ok, that’s enough. I’m not giving out my best stuff here. Or maybe I can’t do any better.</p>
