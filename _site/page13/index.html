  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I had given Twitter a whirl some 7 months ago. I frankly don't know what had gotten into me. You can only type in 160 characters at a time and if you aren't someone whose day-to-day activities genuinely interest a lot of people, it's only bollocks that clutter up the internet. You only need a blog to bloom your ideas and opinions.</p>
<p>Twitter is good for specific people i.e. someone somewhat known who travels a lot and sees something new every day. For the rest of us, who go from home-work-home or home-work-pub-home every day, I fail to see the importance.</p>
<p>Or do I? Perhaps it is an opportunity for a bitchin, grumblin' grump to express himself in a new way. As I find myself with not much time for blogging these days, as is evident by the sparsity of my updates, I can now mitigate that somehow using twitter. Now, equipped with a Nokia E71, I can make a quick note of anything preposterous I see on the train, the street, or anywhere else, many times during the day, as it happens.</p>
<p>Until I realize that I fail to see any meaning in Twitter after all, that is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I recently became the proud owner of a Nokia E71. That's the good news if I assume, for the sake of the conversation, that they haven't taken me for a ride with the new talking plan that I bought. </p>
<p>I already know that as soon as many people see it, they will ask me the Question. No, no that one. The other one. </p>
<p>"Why on Earth didn't you get an iPhone?"</p>
<p> When I was looking for which handset I should buy, I spend a considerable amount of thinking about it. Basically I wanted to choose between the Nokia and the Sony Ericsson C510. The iPhone, never crossed my mind.</p>
<p> Yes, I know that the iPhone is cool, alright? But so are BlackBerries and the E71. There's method in the perceived madness of those of us who write off the iPhone.</p>
<p> 1. It's expensive as fucking hell for a phone. Think about it. The cheapest line rental at O2 with iPhone 3GS(8GB)  and the “simpler” 3G (8GB) is £34.26 a month. Play.com does the 3GS – 8GB for £500. Why pay such money for a handheld that gives you not much more than the next smartphone on the market, nothing that you cannot get on your smartphone off the air without much effort, that is, save the compass, the proximity and the orientation sensors, but these and other small gimmicks aren’t worth the £34.26/month / £500 for the handset. I know there are equally expensive Nokia smartphones in that case you can always go for a cheaper option such as the E71 for £270, if you're buying the handset only.</p>
<p> 2. Battery is not removable. Not acceptable, and it will show if you make full use of your mobile and its software. Using the WLAN or the odd media player is a great way to drain the battery and if you have an iPhone only a nearby socket can save you.</p>
<p> You can buy an original Nokia battery on Nokia website for your E71 for around £20. It’s a saver if you’re on the move and absolutely need your phone when you’re on the move.</p>
<p> 3. Nokia E series has taken after the BlackBerry and employs a physical QWERTY keyboard. When you want to type in a large document, a virtual keyboard like that of the iPhone's won't let you feel when a button is pressed, so you have to continually look up and down between your text and the virtual keyboard. I'm sure that if future versions of the iPhone don't feature a physical keyboard, they will come out with haptic technology which won't be as good as using the real deal (haptics is the technology that interfaces with the user through the sense of touch). I've written this post with my E71 in a series of oveground trips as well as the tube and while I was totally inept when I first started writing this test on its keyboard, i'm now getting better and better.</p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth. iPhone only connects to a wireless headset, a PC or Mac or possibly another iPhone. Not to other non-iPhone handsets.</p>
<p> And these are the reasons why I wouldn't buy an iPhone.</p>
<p> As I was looking at the brochures of the various phone offers I was quite appalled by the various so-called "features" on prominent places in them. Facebook. Youtube.  Bebo. I don't know which is worse; that one out of many criterions for many young people as to which handset to pick is how quickly they can update their status and let the world know that they had a "fab" time last night or the fact that phone makers and vendors actually deem these features important enough to take up a large space on an advert poster. Frankly, you can get to Facebook and whatfucking ever else from any phone that has a browser.</p>
<p> After 5 years in London I think of myself as someone who has pretty much sussed out his mobile phone needs and rougly which calling plans will be the best money saver. Then I'm always surprised by how they manage to keep their calling plans complicated at all times. We live in the free West. Here, the idea is that we have a choice of things by contrast with North Korea or the Middle East or the old Soviet regime. But don't you feel that you were kind of lead on many times when buying something? They lower down the price of something they want to sell most of and then they cap the offer's length. Now, the average worker's salary in London is £27000. Put all of your monthly expenses together, you just want to save money from wherever you can, so you're for going their "offer". That also applies to groceries and pretty much everything else but this entry is only concerned with mobile phones and call plans because this is where it shows the most.</p>
<p>It's just that fucking feeling, that deep down you're had all the time.</p>

    <p>I haven't written anything for a while, not because I haven't found things to be grumpy about (in fact, as my bed has two wrong sides, I can always find things to be grumpy about), but indeed because there are so many I don't know where to start. That, combined with 11 hour work days makes me think I need to do something more constructive with my ever limiting free time. Even more constructive than log anything preposterous I see in order to see nodding heads, that is. However, today this is the most constructive thing I figured I can do for the day.</p>
<p>If you're my age or older you're either married or most of your friends are  married with or without children or in a serious relationship. I don't know how you feel about that. Me, I'm totally indifferent. I couldn't care less.</p>
<p>There is the perception that all men, and I mean ALL men, are sharks who want to get a fling before they settle down with the woman of their life. Maybe that's true, but some of us prefer to spend our time in hobbies we know and tried instead of in women. I think of myself as someone who lives a fulfilling life without having to search for that special someone. Although I do want to settle with the right woman in the distant future I'm resisting all social pressure to pursue a fling. Because this is what it's all about.</p>
<p>I want to be able to live in a world where nobody thinks that there must be a reason why you're single while 30+. I want to live in a world where when you tell a fellow bloke of your last night out, he doesn't jump in to ask you "nice one geezer, did you pull any birds?", but rather if the musicwas good or if the drinks weren't spiked or how the guy who tried to take my turn at Burger King reacted when I said to him that his mom left her flip-flops at my house.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I'm merely enjoying myself during the limited spare time I've got per week and if the right woman comes along, so much the better. If not, c' est la vie. Casual flings, they're not for me, unless they involve older women with whom I know I can't have a relationship.</p>
<p>I guess I'm something a prospective girlfriend would call a "commitment phobic". That's right. Whoever doesn't want to get married or to have a woman to tell you what time she expects you home, or do this and that or you're pretty much happy with your life when you just flirt about, is stuck with the clinical condition of "commitment-o-phobia". Mind you I've also met women who suffer from "commitment-o-phobia". I don't know if they get the attention of women who don't suffer from it, perhaps not so much as we "commitment-phobic" men draw most oftheir fire.  I don't know if you can get something from over-the-counter to mitigate the symptoms and even if there is, it's most likely placebo.</p>
<p>Normally I don't make a song and dance about the merits of my single life but whoever asks, learns.  This time I made an exception as a fellow bachelor may find his way to this blog and read this and nod in agreement.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>You should have seen me puff when fast pacing to the train station this morning. I got on the train after all but only because it was to stay on the station for 10 minutes before it was cleared for departure. And this is where realisation came down.</p>
<p>You will probably agree that this city has far too many people. Imagine what your life in London would be like if the population here was 40% less than it is now. Yes, I know it's mostly immigrants like me who make things worse but what would you have done in my place? Anyway, it's times like these when you realise how overcrowded this place is. It's a scene that repeated itself many times before. The train remains stationary indefinitely whilst we are standing inside crammed like sardines and those of us who can get a glimpse at the platform can see everyone else who arrives later than us and scans the train doors cursorily. We all hope that whatever they plan to do will involve moving down the platform and trying another door. Some of them do. Some others want to become your enemy, mumble a cursory "excuse me" and get in through the same door you did and squeeze themselves next to you.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, the temperature is 25C and some "fellow" passengers didn't take a shower before leaving for work. This means that while you leave your house squeaky clean, by the time you get to the office you smell other people's scents and your coworkers will have to endure that for at least 8 hours.</p>
<p>I'm surprised that everyone takes this without  complaint. I remember when I had to do this in my country. Now, anyone who has visited Greece must have realised we are a very gregarious people. A similar scene at a train station during rush hour would be amusing to say the least.</p>
<p><em>"Move down the train, we can't get inside"</em></p>
<p><em>"Well, lady, you can see we're packed. Try another door."</em></p>
<p><em>"Why, I still see some space there somewhere."</em></p>
<p><em>"There's no space, go somewhere else"</em></p>
<p><em>"For Christ's sake!" (tries to squeeze in, pisses off everybody she pushes) </em></p>
<p><em>"Which part of 'piss off' don't you understand?"</em></p>
<p><em>(Loudly)"Well, you have the manners of a fucking Paki(*), you know that? Is that what you are? A smelly Paki?"</em></p>
<p>A trip by tube had to ensue next as I was going to be late for work otherwise. It's far worse down under as there is no fresh air to come through the windows.</p>
<p>This photo was taken 11 hours later back in London Bridge.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-54" title="Train Delays" src="assets/train-delays1.jpg?w=1023" alt="Train Delays" width="1023" height="309" /></p>
<p>I normally associate all those "Delayed" notifications with a movie where a catastrophic terrorist attack is imminent and all flights or train services have been put on hold until the affected area is cleared. Later on, "Delayed" becomes "Cancelled", which means that conventional means failed to take down the terrorist threat and the protagonist must come in. I didn't stay in London Bridge long enough to see "Delayed" change to anything else.</p>
<p>The official story was that there was a lineside fire in the London Bridge area. It was either that or someone wanted to call it an early evening and came up with that elaborate excuse. I mean, does anyone really and truly know what a "lineside fire" even mean other that it's something that emerges just make you see your partner and kids with a two hour delay?</p>
<p>It may have taken them one hour to resume the trains, it could still be going on. Fuck in heaven knows. I can visualise the railtrack repairmen work 15 minutes at a time and take 45 minute long tea breaks in between and all that while getting paid by the hour. After all, it's not like we can somehow retaliate. Can we switch from our current provider and buy monthly travelcards to use with a different railway company that uses different, weather and fire-resistant railways and trains with larger people capacity that get us where we want to go without any delays? If we get to work 35 minutes late can we advise our friends not to use Southeastern Rail because, say, company XYZ does the same route but is on time more often for 3/4 of the current monthly fare? Can we balls.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:.8em;">Stairs to platforms 1 and 2. Watch your belongings.</span></p>
<p>(*) Back home we're still allowed to talk like that. In public. Regardless whether Pakistani immigrants are around and listening. And I can attest that this exchange did happen.</p>

    <p>It beggars fucking belief. For many weeks the Jubilee line has been closed on weekends.</p>
<p>Jubilee Line is one of the most modern-looking tube lines which connects together a great deal of south east London. I don't know how they are "transforming our tube" and it probably will be a seemless operation to us anyway. After they're done with the transformations we will continue taking the tube as before and still be crammed in like sardines during the rush hour.</p>
<p>I wonder if someone high up in the TFL chain of command wakes up on a Monday morning and thinks "right, whose weekend shall I fuck up this week? Ah yeah, these fuckers living in Rotherhithe, Canada Water, West Hampstead, St John's Wood and Swiss Cottage have had it easy until now, how about I go about having Jubilee Line closed every weekend for the next six months?"</p>
<p>We wouldn't have had any of this if it weren't for the Olympics and a handful of wealthy foreigners who will use the Tube for two weeks and will then leave never to be seen or heard from again. Who gives a shit for the residents of this town who will remain here after the Olympics have finished? If we are benefited at all by this "transformation" it will be nothing but a side effect.</p>
