    <p><strong>Dear Uncle JD,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have been in my current role of Senior Developer for a software agency for about a year now. As my job title suggests, I should be someone who makes decisions and also improves the software methodologies of the organisation. But ever since I started working here, I've been adding buttons on web pages, adding fields into HTML forms, writing API calls or adding optional properties to entities on said APIs. I get pressured by project managers to lower my effort points and time estimates because "the client won't like this and may take their business elsewhere" and then insist to take 20% off those time estimates and turn them into deadlines. I'm the sole developer for many projects.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We nominally do code reviews but more often than not they never get done as everyone else is busy with their own tight deadlines. My project managers always push for the quick-and-dirty solution "just for now" so we can get something "out of the door". The result of this is that I lose interest in the work I'm doing and I often cobble something up just to get it out of the way and relieve some stress on me and yet I still stay in the office until 8pm every weeknight. Of course, it goes without saying that we never revisit that old code to make it right, after all, refactoring released code isn't adding functionality and isn't putting food on the table. Instead, we keep adding functionality to the spaghetti code out there and I find myself slowing down and working harder to manually test everything as a result of this. I now think I'm exhibiting OCD symptoms before a deployment to production. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My question to you is this: am I a complete knobhead for not speaking up more often and getting my point across, or just a partial one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Idiotic and dismayed</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Idiotic and Dismayed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I'm fully aware that technical staff such as devs, DBAs and Ops do everything in their power to avoid conflict. We prefer to work with machines rather than people as machines are more predictable and they don't have the downside of a personality being attached to them, though it may so seem every time you're getting an "Object reference is not set to an instance of an object" error.</p>
<p>As technical staff you want to take the "path of least resistance" when it comes to interacting with people who "don't get the code". This often leads to the problems you've described. Perhaps there'll be a little back-and-forth and the PM may make a concession or two but, let's come off it, if we were good with people and were able to get a point across, we'd be PMs ourselves. </p>
<p>After all how many software job adverts have you not seen in recent years where they're asking for people who can communicate with non-technical staff? I mean they've really got a front to ask for this, haven't they? Sure, at the university you've done a lot of by-now-outdated courses that simulated a software team in a company but you knew this isn't real and if it's anything like that when you get your first job, it'll be fine. Well, it <em>is</em> like that at your first job but instead of other clueless second-years you have seasoned 50 year-old project managers wanting things from you so they can feed their families and you can feed yours. That shit is real and there's no denying it.</p>
<p>When you were thinking of responding to their job opening, what else on the job spec? Did it say that you have to be able to meet tight deadlines and work under pressure? If so, they really meant it. They're not actually saying "there'll be the occasional tight deadline but for most of the time you'll be alright" but "you have to release yesterday every day and you'll be managing multiple projects on the same day, alternating every half an hour with people moaning to your PM over the phone". </p>
<p>Nobody said it was going to be easy, my boy.</p>

    <p>Some of us are coding for a living. Anyone who says this isn't hard business, I dare to come write code, attend meetings, plan tasks, estimate time frames, write clean code and be there at 3AM for server maintenance.</p>
<p>But this isnt about all that. This is about learning new skills every couple of years at most, and that's pushing it.</p>
<p>If you're a doctor or a lawyer you can relate. New medical techniques come out all the time, new cures are invented. Maybe you're one of the people doing the inventing. New laws are voted all the time and others change. And in software development, new technologies emerge almost every day. As far as the end user is concerned, marketers are just shoving down the users' throats just another way of doing something they're already doing until they buy it. But for the developer who programs the software in your devices, it's a living. In the olden days of 2006, you could be irrelevant in five years if you didn't make an effort to update your skills. Now this is down to two. As technology has become cheap to produce and continuous delivery has made software release more often, we're bombarded by new software that we can use to build other software all the time.</p>
<p>Keeping up with all this technology requires at least another 40 hours a week if you're not just reading books and journals but you get "hands on" with some new shit in order to get practical experience too. </p>
<p>If you're a potential employer how do you hire developers who are up to date with cutting edge technologies and demonstrate that they won't start wrapping things up for the day when the clock strikes 4.50pm but also won't feel that other aspects of their lives are being neglected if they work unpaid overtime often? </p>
<p>I'm here to help. None of the ideas below is mine, I've looked at various job postings from start-ups looking for software developers and engineers and have compiled a list of requirements I've found in those. They're all looking for "passionate" developers who do as many of the following as possible.</p>
<h3>Github profile</h3>
<p>If you're not commiting to Github often, it's safe to assume thay when you go home you do other things than coding. You're quite likely to do a worse job than developers who <em>do</em> make regular commits to open source repositories because these other people just <em>so can't get out of it</em> they use much of their free time to code and it doesn't look like it's burning them out. Also, they've most certainly had more practice under their belts and they'll make better candidates.</p>
<p>Also, as most of the code people write is commercial and closed source, we can only tell what sort of coder you are if you have some code samples of yours uploaded somewhere.</p>
<p>In fact some employers don't even bother with CVs anymore. Go to Github right now or you simply don't exist.</p>
<h3>Blogs</h3>
<p>Unless you want the hiring manager to assume that it's all take-take-take with you, you'd better have a blog where you contribute articles to the software community. In an era of instant global communication, there is so much demand for answers and ideas in this field that one blog and one framework per developer <em>still</em> won't saturate the Internet. This is not only true for developers alive today but for all new industry entrants from now until technology lets us down and we decide to ban it.</p>
<p>So go and buy some hosting space and set up a blog using a well-known CMS with a large community. It will only take an hour. Come on, I'll wait.</p>
<p>I know you've still here. Get moving!</p>
<p>Alright, future unemployed developer, I don't care. It's on you.</p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p>Because we want to know your thoughts about all things programming and if you're following the industry leaders we like. We also want to see a glimpse of your character.</p>
<h3>Stack Overflow</h3>
<p>Do you participate in heated debates about what constitutes a single responsibility of a module? Do you answer questions as often as we want to see someone answer questions? Oh, come on, now, be social. It's pretty much the same as maintaining a blog, sharing ideas and all, only this time you're helping someone who's asked for help. </p>
<h3>Open source projects</h3>
<p>That kind of looks like the Github one but we're talking about full-fledged solo or team projects already released or with a clear and promised intent to be released. In other words it's not you just experimenting and generally mucking anout. This is your opportunity to shine. Hey, I've helped made this! Maybe it's something the technical director of the hiring company is already brought to the organisation or considering using and has heard your name as one of the contributors. <em>I'm lucky enough this bloke's looking for work right now</em>, he'll think.</p>
<p>Of course, it could well be that you write splendid code while you're at work, that makes PMs, clients and stakeholders happy and you do none of these other things. The problem is that the hiring manager of the company you want to work for can't see the work you're doing on your 9-to-5 because it's proprietary. We thought of portfolios as something designers and front-end web developers do to show their work when they're between jobs but this has now spread to back-end developers. Next thing you know, DBAs will need to present a portfolio when they're being interviewed.</p>
<p>It's difficult to keep up with new technology as software creation has become so cheap a process you can potentially have one or more frameworks per developer. I'd say this is especially harder for people with  family commitments as they have their family commitments intervene, but I won't because that would be marital-statusism. The world is already unfair enough to single people once they've passed 30. It's more difficult to get a work visa somewhere when you don't have a partner to apply together with. Holiday packages are cheaper per person if two people travel together. Food portions in grocery stores always seem too much if you're only feeding yourself so you have to store it in the freezer but some food was frozen before it was sold and cannot be refrozen. Single workers apparently have no excuse not to study work-related things outside of work as what's perceived as the most important commitment outside of work is not applicable in their case. You hear this often: "I'd love to code outside of work but I've got a family and I can't find much time". Well, shit. I've got friends,  a girlfriend, I go out more often since I'm young and pretty and want to be seen and I've got a few other hobbies and interests. Maybe I'll even work the fuck out if I'm feeling special. And if I'm not, I'll stay at home, watch internet porn and have a wank because I've had a long day and it's still Tuesday, so fuck right fucking off. In short, I'm just as busy as a married with children person and my day is just 24 hours long as theirs. But no, if you're not committed to a married life all your activities outside of work are sacrificeable to maintain a technology blog, commit to Github often and contribute to open source projects, be on Twitter and answer questions on Stack Overflow. You need to update your skills all the time because new things come out all the time and there's no end in it. Do away with personal care. No one needs a shower every fucking day and if you're not client-facing you don't even need to be clean shaven. Or trim your stubble. </p>
<p>This is a hypercompetitive and materialistic world and you're a talented developer in a city full of them. But do all that and you'll keep abreast of those that don't, and eliminate a large chunk of the competition. Because if you become complacent, your time <em>will</em> come,  <em>you fat, bearded, cheetos-eating, Dr. Pepper-drinking, World of Warcraft-playing, nose-picking and snot-eating motherfucking fuck-shit</em>. This is a global depression we're living in. Employers have become more selective so if you don't want to die in a cardboard box, you'd better do as I'm telling you.</p>
<p>And when you're made redundant at 55 and can't find another job because you're overqualified and can be replaced by someone with half the experience and money, you'll wish you had spent some of that time going out more often, making friends and finding a girlfriend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Technology has penetrated every aspect of our lives. Just to take the internet as a sole example, in the twenty years that we've had it as we know it, life has changed radically.</p>
<p>So at this time and age surely you'd think someone would have built something that just bloody works? 'Cos most of the things I've seen or used don't.</p>
<p>WordPress editor - extra lines appearing intermittently out of nowhere and you can only remove them if you go to plain text view and press backspace or delete over whitespace.<br />
Smartphone - it's got ridiculously slow over the past few months and I had to disable most apps that came with the phone without me asking for them just to give it some extra speed. I also had to manually clear the cache of every working app as the internal RAM was still in critical mass.<br />
Camera - Battery only lasts a couple of outings. Maybe an outing and a half if I make heavier use of it. Also the battery icon only has three indications: Full, One Bar Down and Blinking Red: About To Shut Off.</p>
<p>In fact the only things I've seen have worked consistently as per factory specs for the years I've had them are my mini vacuum cleaner and my stubble trimmer.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-649 size-full" src="/assets/trimmer.jpg" alt="Trimmer" width="212" height="128" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">There's actually a set of larger blades that comes with it. I use it to shave my bollocks.</p>
<p>So nice work, us! It only took us fifty fucking years to make a vacuum cleaner and a razor blade work as they should.</p>
<p>In the 50s they told our parents that by 2000 we'll be commuting to work via jet capsules that will be travelling inside tubes that will be sprawling across the city. I remember this envisioned future being told to us by teachers and media In the 80s even, although the "by" year was shifted a bit forward. To this day we've not seen super-tall buildings, spiralling carriageways that go up in the sky and robot taxi drivers.</p>
<p>Yeah, what happened to those, I wonder? You'd think robots would be capable enough these days to ask you your destination, drive you somewhere and then ask for the fare or get out of the car and chase you at superhuman speed should you attempt a runner.</p>
<p>Robots do become more complicated but they're not yet ready for a real end-user application. This is how the history of robotics can be summed up, as this was demonstrated in various university research facilities around the world:<br />
1980: Robot walks on flat surface and avoids obstacles.<br />
1990: Robot walks on a flat surface and avoids obstacles but it's made up of more complicated parts.<br />
2000: Robot walks on a flat surface and avoids obstacles but it's made up of even more complicated parts.<br />
2010: Robot that looks incredibly like a Japanese woman if you watch a video of it in 144p, walks like the robots of the past three decades, raises its hands like a robot of the past three decades and blinks.</p>
<p>The same goes for the web. The internet's scope hasn't changed in the last 15 years, said scope being to search for information, shop and have a wank, but today it's done with large beasts that are programmed in two or more languages. Websites tend to behave as an interactive desktop application. Instead of keeping the same stateless HTTP that drives the whole web and dance around it with cookies and hidden HTML fields and what have you, why can't we upgrade the protocol to allow duplex connection and phase out the existing HTTP? As if this were not all, some companies are treating some web standards as guidelines only and that leaves us poor sods having to code around their non-compliance to those standards.</p>
<p>Recently, Google held a "keynote" presenting its new products. From an end user's perspective they're just the same as the old products only a bit fancier with fancier animations and they're planning to put Android into more things, including wristwatches that can read notifications from your phone. Because, really, that's what was missing from the world. Google finally responded to the deluge of user feedback desperately asking to have a wristwatch that can show a fraction of what an Android phone does, at the price of three watches that can't do that.</p>
<p>What do you mean they had not had such feedback?</p>
<p>Most people who own an expensive smartphone use it in the same manner as they used to use an expensive smartphone before it was called a smartphone: call people, send texts and plan your day with the built-in calendar and task list. Only now they can do it on a 24-month contract. Would any of them go back to a Sony Ericsson K-800? No. Someone told us these old phones are no longer cool and trendy and you need those new touch screen ones with the faster processor and the better animations. I want to show my new S-fucking-5 to my peers, the K-800i is so 2008. And this is in fact where technology has gone wrong. It's become a fashionable thing and has been left to the marketing cocks of business outfits to decide what new gadget we get to see next but if there's one thing for sure it's that at the very least they shove the successor of last year's model down our throats every year. Unless you have £500 to spend on a new fucking "smart"-phone every year you'll probably be replacing it less often but since marketing cocks have convinced you that they seem like they're ten-a-penny, if you drop it and it breaks you'll probably think "well, it's been 13 months, time for a new one anyway. Also a 2014 phone looks more like a 2014 phone as opposed to the 2013 model I bought last year." Silly? Well, evidently it works.</p>
<p>The same goes for us on the producing side of technology. You learn a new way to create a web application that just Creates/Reads/Updates/Deletes records from a database. When you've got a good grasp of it, bam, it's different. Not only did it work before they changed it, it also worked well. Now it's working well but it may have more bugs in it. As far as the end user is concerned unless there's new functionality in an application or significant visual changes they couldn't give a rat's left bollock how it works under the bonnet.</p>
<p>Before you shove all kinds of useless bells and whistles into something, make sure whatever's already there works. Before you put a 12MP camera into the latest phone, it'd help if you kept the 8MP cameras they have right where they are but fix them so they can take non-grainy photos even if we're not pointing them directly at the sun. Compact cameras; same thing. Give us better image quality without noise. I don't know anyone who uses the smile detection feature. Also, the ISO 3200 mode in most, if not all, compact cameras produce photos which are shit but hey let's include an ISO6400 one! But then again the sales department would have a hard time to sell a non-inclusion of new bells and whistles.</p>
<blockquote><p>" We don't have enough time to fix things <em>and</em> add new things before our cut-off release deadline date so in our new flagship model coming out this year we thought we should have existing functionality work better instead of adding anything new. Well, surely the processor is new but we don't make them ourselves anyway. If you have our previous model you surely have noticed that if you take photos in any lighting conditions other than an exploding nuclear bomb you're hard-pressed to tell what those grains in the photo are supposed to make up. So now the camera will produce good photos in sunny and overcast days too and we didn't add extra megapixels. Also we increased the battery life so your new phone can go for over 12 hours without recharging by sticking in a bigger battery and making the phone the size of a brick."</p>
<p>- Advert on new features</p></blockquote>
<p>This loop we've fallen into is perfectly summed up in a cartoon I saw somewhere a few weeks ago where a guy plays a new racing game in his console and his girlfriend says "This looks like like the game you were playing last year" and the boyfriend goes "no that one was Drive Fast 4. This is Drive fast 5." The girlfriend then says something like "so you're racing other cars in Drive Fast 5 just like you did in Drive Fast 4. What's the difference?" and the boyfriend goes "but can't you see the pixel shading in this new one?"</p>
<p>This is a vicious cycle in which our standards are low and corporations don't bother releasing anything above them. Because they don't make anything radical, we become accustomed to and take what they give us without giving much thought to what greatness could be invented.</p>
<p>But no one ever listens to me so you just get what's coming to you really.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>For some time now I've been working in a large office environment. I did some contracting work for another client once so I had had a bit of exposure in such a setting before, but never until now had I really pondered as to how things work in one.</p>
<p>Without further ado...</p>
<p><strong>1. Team work</strong><br />
Bigger companies are more organised than startups, which means that if you are a lower level employee in your department, there is a lot of other yous to spread the work on and leave for home just a bit after but as close to 5 pm as possible. I'd worked at a startup where it was headphones-on for 10 continuous hours, each developer working on a different project. Nowadays the same work is done by an agile team of three or four. There needs to be constant communication between the team members and between the team and the business. We enjoy a pint or two after work but more on this later.</p>
<p><strong>2. No one implements anything fully</strong><br />
I'm sure it happens in every trade but I'll talk about IT. Agile. Scrum. Test-Driven Development. Outside-in Development. Forget what they ask you in job interviews. Have you ever done a sprint retrospective AND a sprint review at the end of each sprint in all of the settings you've practiced Scrum? Do you sprint each time you add features? Do you write no more production code until you have all of the unit test code that will cover it? These techniques/principles are there to help us deliver functionality to the business but some of it is "forgotten" as we program that functionality. You know this. Your interviewer knows this. It's definitely a better way to develop software rather than the old "we've got to get the motherfucking thing out of the door yesterday" management style by people in startups who haven't taken a single management course. I've personally never known of a company that does Outside-in development. Yes, by all means you can do what you want with your home projects which have no delivery date by which your market commitments start. At work, it's different. A bit like the impression you get after three interviews where you think you'll be joining The Mother Of All TDD Practices and on your first days in it's all "we should really automate that build" or "we've finally found some time to retrofit the last two releases with unit and integration tests, would you mind helping Team X with writing some?"</p>
<p><strong>3. The office hot babe</strong><br />
It's the one you wish your wife or girlfriend was hot as. She knows it and acts like it. She shakes more than an earthquake when she walks. There's no way she hasn't got a boyfriend. There's also no way of knowing how the hell he got into her pants through all the competition although you can take a pretty good guess. Most likely she's a receptionist or a PR manager or a special assistant to a very, very senior executive.</p>
<p>Yes, by all means look but avoid prolonged stares. Do you want the whole office to see you staring at her arse? Is it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>4. Office parties: You don't have to go.</strong><br />
In a startup you would attend a shared office party. Non-attendance would mean that a noticeable 10% of the workforce would not show. "Fuck off, I can't be arsed" is not an acceptable reason not to go to that Christmas party. Just see it as paid overtime.</p>
<p>Not so in large companies. You have the option of non-attendance. Simply don't RSVP (or whatever the fuck it's called) when you receive the invitation e-mail. They'll all have better things to do at the party than see if you've come.</p>
<p>First off, the beer is free and after a few you may have a slip of the tongue, if you're getting my drift. Second of all, though you may like everyone in your office, you're already spending at least 40 hours a week with people most of which you wouldn't naturally be friends with. Do you want to see more of these people in your free evenings? Sure have a pint or two with your team if you have to but then go back to your friends. That's how I see it. To each his own I guess. I think I speak for most developers when I say that we didn't get into this line of work because we like people. We prefer the deterministic behaviour of the machines we program and not the hassle of unpredictable interpersonal relationships.</p>
<p><strong>5. Not just you, no one else knows bloody anything</strong><br />
Ok, most of us get the gist of what we've come here to do. As you get to know people who work in more "serious" positions, you get to realize that they're just acting it up and are unsure of what exactly is expected of them. They like you to think they've got a good handle of things but all they're doing is making a quasi-good attempt at hiding that they don't. Unlike in the Old Country, most people here have a BA or BSc in something completely unrelated. Quite often, what you're assessed on day in and day out is demonstrating that you know how to take orders, work hard and suggest departmental strategies. But be careful: do it only up to a point, preferably when your input is allowed and don't rock the boat. If there are situations no one likes to change but drive you up a wall, it's time to dust off that CV. In a job interview you should say that you've practiced Scrum and TDD and have proposed and implemented certain alterations in the way the department delivers functionality, which took productivity to skyrocketing levels, although for all you know you and everyone else have been sitting at your desks typing things into a computer.</p>
