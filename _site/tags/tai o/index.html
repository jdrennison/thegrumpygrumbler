<a title="Angry Traveller’s review – Hong Kong Part 3 (final) – The good bits" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/angry-travellers-review-hong-kong-part-3/">Part 3</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong is an amazing place. I spent two weeks there recently and I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>Well, I said it. You thought I was going to whine like a little bitch right from the get-go didn't you? Oh, well here it comes.</p>
<p>"Most people like to spend only a few days there. What did you do in two weeks? Did you not get bored?", I hear you ask. Although I don't have to, let me explain.</p>
<p>First off, I've done the "few days in Hong Kong" type of thing and it left me with a bitter taste in the mouth. I felt I was doing Hong Kong a disservice by just half-arsing it through the most popular tourist attractions in two days and then fucking off. Never again, I said as soon as I took off from Chek Lap Kok. Hong Kong, we will meet again soon.</p>
<p>Second, I did want to go to the mainland very much but you really have to take three weeks off work to really enjoy it. I could have done 4 days in Beijing, 4 days in Shanghai, 4 days in Hong Kong but I'd be pressed for time and I'd love to spend more days to enjoy each.</p>
<p>Third, I'm not "most people", it's my fucking trip and I can do whatever the fuck I want with it.</p>
<p>They say jet lag is worse when you travel eastbound but this theory doesn't hold water. The jet lag is always worse when you return home from your holiday, always. Also, the flight is always longer. So the perceived time that passes when flying back to the UK always seem longer than the perceived time that passes when flying to Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>After a day of orientation where I did absolutely nothing (they say a task length expands to fill in the available time you have to do it) I went to a well-known dim sum restaurant in Kowloon. This is the conversation that transpired between me and the waitress:</p>
<p>-Excuse me, did you just order chicken feet?<br />
-Yeah. You haven't just run out of it have you?<br />
-Are you sure you want chicken feet? Do you know what it is?<br />
-Yes I know what chicken feet is.</p>
<p>So off she takes and a few seconds later she comes back with a bowl with a couple of chicken paws in it as a last chance to back down before I get it on my table, I guess. I simply nodded and insisted to get it.</p>
<p>I thought that to them, "The West" is a big obscure weird place where everyone loathes the idea of eating any animal parts that aren't from the shoulders or the thighs or the back or the chest of said animal.</p>
<blockquote><p>Son, make sure you do your vaccinations when you visit Europe. I've heard those people like to eat pork ribs and spaghetti.</p>
<p>-Chinese dad to his son</p></blockquote>
<p>In some restaurants in Chinatown in London they mark certain dishes in the menu as "not recommended for European taste" and those are the dishes that attract my interest the most. What do you mean "not recommended"? Perhaps they should change the notice to something like "not recommended for British taste". Because if I told the cooks in any of the restaurants there what we sometimes eat in the Old Country, they'd rip up their cooking certificates and get on the first boat back to China. I brought up some examples to a Hong Kong Chinese. Her reaction: ewwwhowcanyoueatthisthisissodisgustingohmygod.</p>
<blockquote><p>After this I can safely claim that the mysteries of the Orient are no mystery to me. Will you let me have you now, cute Hong Kong girl?</p>
<p>-Agent Johnny English to cute Hong Kong girl</p></blockquote>
<h2>Tailor Touts</h2>
<p>This applies in every place there are touts.<br />
If you've been to Tsim Sha Tsui and you look whi... sorry, I mean Western, you know what I'm taking about. Picture yourself in front of the mirror thinking this:</p>
<p>- Hell yeah. Nice suit I got after all. I only stopped by Hong Kong for a couple of nights on my way to Auckland and I already own 20 suits but there was this kind Indian gentleman who kept following me around the block saying things like "Hey, where do you think you're going? Look at me when I'm talking to you! Just stop for a minute to have a look at my catalogue!". That's what persuaded me to buy this £300 suit.</p>
<p>You may have been in this position once or know someone who has?</p>
<p>What do you mean you don't? I don't know, it might have something to do with that it hasn't happened to anyone in the history of man.</p>
<p>No one likes touts. Fucking no one.</p>
<p>I know and respect the fact that these people are only trying to put food on the table but this business model is worth observing. This is the 2010s. There are businesspeople around the world who think that having someone troll tourist spots and grab unsuspecting tourists by the bollocks and drag them into a dungeon with merchandise is just as effective as dishing out flyers (they already print out price lists on thick paper) or listing their businesses on Trip Advisor or doing viral marketing. Or do some shit other than employing touts. Touts should at last get through their thick skulls that if someone is ignoring them or mumbling "no thanks" while not looking at them doesn't mean "I'm ambivalent about buying one of your beautiful, high-quality thread suits but run behind me and say to me 'Hold on just for a second, just to take a look at the suits we can make for you' one more time and I'll be sure to stop and pay you cash in hand for the suit, a pair of shiny leather shoes and a cotton shirt without even asking for a guarantee that the goods will ship to my address because I'm the trusting guy".</p>
<p>There is a female and less-aggresive version of touts in Soho and Lan Kwai Fong. I don't know if there's a similar English saying but in the Old Country we have a saying: "a cunt hair can pull a cargo ship". I want to believe that the post-modern sophisticated expat men who have travelled half the globe to be there do not subscribe to this saying and won't fall for a short skirt standing outside a bar trying to lure men in. For the most part I am right. However, I did not include the Wan Chai district. More on this in Part 2.</p>
<h2>Lantau Island day tour</h2>
<p>I can't quite remember the tour guide's name but she said to just remember it rhymes with 'queen'. "They call me 'The Queen' in these parts", she went on to say in her fake American accent. "In fact I've been likened to Queen Latifah". Well, she wasn't <strong>entirely </strong>talking out of her arsehole. If Queen Latifah had an illegitimate child with Mr. Chow from Hangover this is what it'd look like. Later on when she said there is no such thing as Lantau Peak and there's only one Peak and that is in Hong Kong island, I decided not to correct her in front of the group mostly because I was going to look more of a twat than she would.</p>
<p>Tai O. A picturesque fishing village almost entirely built on stilts. The fishermen there are probably tired of gweilo faces walking around the place but I think a large part of the local revenue is generated by tourism so they generally shut up about it and take our money.</p>
<p>There, just as in the rest of Hong Kong, they sell dried seafood. The tour guide expressed her, let's call it, indignation that some tourists are surprised that Hong Kongers eat smelly food. "Well why do you eat blue cheese", she said. "This may be as strange to us as us eating smelly food is strange to you". Someone had to explain to her that the West is a big place and in lots of parts of it we find blue cheese disgusting. Hell, I don't even know what blue cheese is. It sounds like one of those cheeses that come with a fungus in them and you're supposed to just eat it along with the cheese. She should be aware of all that already before she addresses all of the group as "you". I was going to explain this to her in front of the group but, you guessed it, it was going to make me look more of a twat than her. Alternatively I would chat to her during the "free time" segments of the tour had she not decided to disappear or just ignore us for a fag. Yes, her job is probably boring but she'll probably have to do something else soon. The numbers of tourists that go to these tours are dwindling. These days we have smartphones with applications and we can learn everything we want from travel websites. In the group I was in, there were no more than six people including me. I'm sure that just like me they booked the tour just to get an easy way to cruise around Lantau's hot spots and see as many attractions as possible without waiting and changing many buses, not because this is the best or only way to go to Lantau.</p>
<p>Ngong Ping village. That's not immediately obvious from the tourist brochures but despite its "traditional"-sounding name this is an artificial village with no permanent residents. The "village" is part of the Ngong Ping 360 tourist site which has souvenir shops, restaurants, ice cream kiosks and a Starbucks. The giveaway was the Starbucks. Non-artificial Hong Hong villages don't have Starbucks.</p>
<p>By the way, do you know that smell that comes from the rubbish bins on a street from which a seafood street market has just closed business and left for the day? That's what dried seafood in Hong Kong smells like.</p>
