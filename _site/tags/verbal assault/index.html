    <p>Twitter can be utter shit yet other times can be a good source of information about what's happening in your city.</p>
<p>I was recently reading the feed of editor Fiona Mountford who claims she got pushed and verbally abused on the tube. </p>
<p>What did everyone else on the carriage did to defend the lady in distress?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Man offers to fight me on platform of next station. I kindly decline offer. All men in carriage resolutely avoid my gaze.</p>
<p>&mdash; Fiona Mountford (@FionaLondonarts) <a href="https://twitter.com/FionaLondonarts/statuses/444221480193499136">March 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>So, once again, a big thank you to all the men in the carriage, who did nothing while I was being threatened. Genuine thanks to kind ladies.</p>
<p>&mdash; Fiona Mountford (@FionaLondonarts) <a href="https://twitter.com/FionaLondonarts/statuses/444226851897376768">March 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Damn those men who let her be abused and did nothing to intervene. If I were there I would be the first to jump up from my seat and say (doing a Jason Statham voice) "the lady said to leave her alone". Seriously, of all the men on the carriage no one stood up for her?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Good+Samaritan+stabbed+in+throat.-a060773708">Oh.</a> <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Good-Samaritan-fatally-shot-as-he-tried-to-stop-1708799.php">Right.</a></p>
<p>Even if you are some spec-ops veteran or a martial arts expert and could take him, we live in a society where if you're not paid handle such incidents, the cops won't take kindly to you getting involved in a potential fight. Be that as it may, even people who are trained to knock out others with bare hands cannot know the outcome of a fight beforehand and could still be sent to hospital. Not defending themselves or a loved one but a complete stranger. Most people (men included) are not trained fighters.</p>
<p>I wouldn't intervene if a stranger was getting beaten because:<br />
1. You could get harmed or killed when you could just not have provoked the assailant. Someone else was the object of their wrath. C'est la vie. The two links above are an example of what could happen.<br />
2. You become the new target giving the original target the opportunity to scarper. Would the original target join back the fight?<br />
3. We live in a society where this can get you arrested if you're not trained and appointed by the state to break up fights. When you are arrested:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to find and pay for a good solicitor</li>
<li>You have to take time off work</li>
<li>You, your friends and family are put through trauma for days, weeks or months.</li>
<li>If you're not trained and manage subdue the assailant you don't know what amount of force could be regarded reasonable by the police and if they think you used excessive force you could be charged.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this not when you've done something wrong but something very right.</p>
<p>At least this is what the media says can happen and just who am I to dispute a story saying "Man held by police for defending his home from burglars".</p>
<p>Would you like to have one or more of these happen to you over an incident involving a total stranger? I wouldn't. As an eye witness I'd give a statement to the police when they arrived on scene but never intervene.</p>
<p>Îœany years ago on the train. Two girls sit together, one of them is chatting loudly on the phone. A woman nearby tells her off.</p>
<p>"Aw I didn't realize I'm disturbin' you innit. I talk on the phone and get told off innit. Bloody 'ell no one else's complainin'".</p>
<p>No, she didn't assault the other woman but simply got up and moved further down the train, yet she had taken a risk for challenging the two chavs. If someone is so inconsiderate that talks loudly on the phone on the train, I tend to assume he won't take too kindly to getting told off by a stranger. With all these knife-wielding thugs ridding London you have to assume the worst. After all you're just going to work and you don't want to swing by the hospital on the way there, getting treated for stab wounds. Over two chavs being chavs. Although I'm pretty sure I've picked up a few STDs just by being on the same carriage with them that morning.</p>
<p>I said something to the other woman though: If she was attacked no one would come to her rescue and that's something to think about next time she thinks about doing what everyone else is thinking. She said she would still do the same thing.</p>
<p>And, anyway, all of us who came to live in London later in life and in the first few months tried to help a complete stranger we'd get rejected until we gave up. The proof for this is that I say so. </p>
<p>I've written a few lines of code that illustrates caring for a stranger in a big city:</p>
<p><code>$a = some bad shit that may happen to people while walking on the street.<br />
$x = guy who gets $a<br />
$y = guy who gets paid to take care of people that get $a<br />
$me = !($x || $y)<br />
So $me can fuck off about $me's god-damn business.</code></p>
<p>Just to respond to any allegation of sexism that may arise from the use of the word "guy" in the above source code. I used "guy" instead of "person" because suck my todger, that's why.</p>
