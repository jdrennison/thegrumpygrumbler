    <p>I'd include clichés like the Harbour and the Peak in this post but I'd rather eat my own spleen.</p>
<h2>Mass Transit Railway</h2>
<p>In Admiralty there is a sign that says "MTR keeps you on schedule". In the two weeks I spent there the Hong Kong Metro trains were frequent and would never break down. The metro would just work. I can rely on it to take me to the airport without having to leave five hours before my flight "to allow for extra time". Imagine a big sign at Oxford Circus station: "The Tube keeps you on schedule". The Daily Mail would be all over it hours later with an article titled "Tube bosses think the Tube runs on time and doesn't have signal failures or train breakdowns or people ending their lives on the tracks or weekend closures".</p>
<p>Ok, the title needs a bit more work.</p>
<h2>Surgical masks</h2>
<p>In the last 11 years Hong Kong had had two major viral outbr... errr hang on, hang on. In what way were the SARS and the bird flu major outbreaks? Because if you remember rightly, serious-looking people in suits would parade on the telly to tell us that we were all going to die. But we didn't.</p>
<p>When I hear about a "major outbreak" or a "pandemic", I expect it to be followed up by reports of villages whose whole population has been eradicated overnight. I expect to hear about medical camps hosting thousands of virus-stricken victims in their death throes. When the SARS and the HxNx viruses were in their heydays did all Hong Kong ports close? Were the bridges to Shenzhen closed off or bombed and everyone trying to cross over shot on sight?</p>
<p><a href="https://thegrumbler.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/640px-rz_walker_2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-502" src="assets/640px-rz_walker_2.png" alt="Infected outbreak" width="500" height="209" /></a></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;">And if the virus took away the higher functions of the human brain and made the victim withstand extreme pain would they incinerate the populated areas with thermite plasma?</p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;">-Photo: <span style="color:#d5d4d4;">Added by </span><a style="color:#c61010;" href="http://prototype.wikia.com/wiki/User:Vatsa1708" target="_blank">Vatsa1708</a></p>
<p>And yet there have been government warnings after government warnings and now you see every other person there wear a surgical mask. I'm no expert but I think a surgical mask won't protect you fully as an airborne disease can still enter from the sides but it can reduce the risk of infection. Also you protect others if you're infected. By looking at a train carriage in London every morning I can pick at least ten people who could use a mask. We're no different than Hong Kong in that we can also contract airborne diseases. Always think of surgical masks next time some inconsiderate motherfucking idiot sneezes on you and offers a grovelling apology. What is your "sorry" good for, cunt? Now get the fuck out of my fucking face.</p>
<h2>Food</h2>
<p>Dai Pai Dong must be considered the worst of the worst eateries if the government is trying to close them down. Yet the few times I've been to one, the food seemed as fresh as anywhere else. And it's also a good selling point to tourists. In fact, I liked the food everywhere I've eaten there. When i first moved to the UK it took me nearly a year to get used to the food here. Also, the best takeaway in the UK is worse than the worst takeaway in Hong Kong. Have you tried the kebab in London? Imagine the pus from a skin abscess mixed with flu phlegm and snot. Well, the kebab in the UK is a bit worse than that. I'm not blaming the owners of the UK takeaways, they're just doing what they can with the raw materials they can get. Maybe that's why I've not heard anyone from the government say that they want to shut these shops down.</p>
<h2>Living it up</h2>
<p>I know it's partly due to that there's not enough space for so many people. But these people know how to party. I've seen eateries serving food at 1 am. I don't think they just stay open to serve all those who couldn't be seated when said eateries were full at 8 pm. Food is part of the culture. Alcohol, they do not abuse. You won't see the police picking up drunken slobs from the street who've just glassed someone in the face. People just live their lives consuming things and eating a lot of fresh seafood.</p>
<p>And the safety. I saw once a young girl in a dark street in Mong Kok typing things away on her laptop.</p>
