  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Some of us are coding for a living. Anyone who says this isn't hard business, I dare to come write code, attend meetings, plan tasks, estimate time frames, write clean code and be there at 3AM for server maintenance.</p>
<p>But this isnt about all that. This is about learning new skills every couple of years at most, and that's pushing it.</p>
<p>If you're a doctor or a lawyer you can relate. New medical techniques come out all the time, new cures are invented. Maybe you're one of the people doing the inventing. New laws are voted all the time and others change. And in software development, new technologies emerge almost every day. As far as the end user is concerned, marketers are just shoving down the users' throats just another way of doing something they're already doing until they buy it. But for the developer who programs the software in your devices, it's a living. In the olden days of 2006, you could be irrelevant in five years if you didn't make an effort to update your skills. Now this is down to two. As technology has become cheap to produce and continuous delivery has made software release more often, we're bombarded by new software that we can use to build other software all the time.</p>
<p>Keeping up with all this technology requires at least another 40 hours a week if you're not just reading books and journals but you get "hands on" with some new shit in order to get practical experience too. </p>
<p>If you're a potential employer how do you hire developers who are up to date with cutting edge technologies and demonstrate that they won't start wrapping things up for the day when the clock strikes 4.50pm but also won't feel that other aspects of their lives are being neglected if they work unpaid overtime often? </p>
<p>I'm here to help. None of the ideas below is mine, I've looked at various job postings from start-ups looking for software developers and engineers and have compiled a list of requirements I've found in those. They're all looking for "passionate" developers who do as many of the following as possible.</p>
<h3>Github profile</h3>
<p>If you're not commiting to Github often, it's safe to assume thay when you go home you do other things than coding. You're quite likely to do a worse job than developers who <em>do</em> make regular commits to open source repositories because these other people just <em>so can't get out of it</em> they use much of their free time to code and it doesn't look like it's burning them out. Also, they've most certainly had more practice under their belts and they'll make better candidates.</p>
<p>Also, as most of the code people write is commercial and closed source, we can only tell what sort of coder you are if you have some code samples of yours uploaded somewhere.</p>
<p>In fact some employers don't even bother with CVs anymore. Go to Github right now or you simply don't exist.</p>
<h3>Blogs</h3>
<p>Unless you want the hiring manager to assume that it's all take-take-take with you, you'd better have a blog where you contribute articles to the software community. In an era of instant global communication, there is so much demand for answers and ideas in this field that one blog and one framework per developer <em>still</em> won't saturate the Internet. This is not only true for developers alive today but for all new industry entrants from now until technology lets us down and we decide to ban it.</p>
<p>So go and buy some hosting space and set up a blog using a well-known CMS with a large community. It will only take an hour. Come on, I'll wait.</p>
<p>I know you've still here. Get moving!</p>
<p>Alright, future unemployed developer, I don't care. It's on you.</p>
<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p>Because we want to know your thoughts about all things programming and if you're following the industry leaders we like. We also want to see a glimpse of your character.</p>
<h3>Stack Overflow</h3>
<p>Do you participate in heated debates about what constitutes a single responsibility of a module? Do you answer questions as often as we want to see someone answer questions? Oh, come on, now, be social. It's pretty much the same as maintaining a blog, sharing ideas and all, only this time you're helping someone who's asked for help. </p>
<h3>Open source projects</h3>
<p>That kind of looks like the Github one but we're talking about full-fledged solo or team projects already released or with a clear and promised intent to be released. In other words it's not you just experimenting and generally mucking anout. This is your opportunity to shine. Hey, I've helped made this! Maybe it's something the technical director of the hiring company is already brought to the organisation or considering using and has heard your name as one of the contributors. <em>I'm lucky enough this bloke's looking for work right now</em>, he'll think.</p>
<p>Of course, it could well be that you write splendid code while you're at work, that makes PMs, clients and stakeholders happy and you do none of these other things. The problem is that the hiring manager of the company you want to work for can't see the work you're doing on your 9-to-5 because it's proprietary. We thought of portfolios as something designers and front-end web developers do to show their work when they're between jobs but this has now spread to back-end developers. Next thing you know, DBAs will need to present a portfolio when they're being interviewed.</p>
<p>It's difficult to keep up with new technology as software creation has become so cheap a process you can potentially have one or more frameworks per developer. I'd say this is especially harder for people with  family commitments as they have their family commitments intervene, but I won't because that would be marital-statusism. The world is already unfair enough to single people once they've passed 30. It's more difficult to get a work visa somewhere when you don't have a partner to apply together with. Holiday packages are cheaper per person if two people travel together. Food portions in grocery stores always seem too much if you're only feeding yourself so you have to store it in the freezer but some food was frozen before it was sold and cannot be refrozen. Single workers apparently have no excuse not to study work-related things outside of work as what's perceived as the most important commitment outside of work is not applicable in their case. You hear this often: "I'd love to code outside of work but I've got a family and I can't find much time". Well, shit. I've got friends,  a girlfriend, I go out more often since I'm young and pretty and want to be seen and I've got a few other hobbies and interests. Maybe I'll even work the fuck out if I'm feeling special. And if I'm not, I'll stay at home, watch internet porn and have a wank because I've had a long day and it's still Tuesday, so fuck right fucking off. In short, I'm just as busy as a married with children person and my day is just 24 hours long as theirs. But no, if you're not committed to a married life all your activities outside of work are sacrificeable to maintain a technology blog, commit to Github often and contribute to open source projects, be on Twitter and answer questions on Stack Overflow. You need to update your skills all the time because new things come out all the time and there's no end in it. Do away with personal care. No one needs a shower every fucking day and if you're not client-facing you don't even need to be clean shaven. Or trim your stubble. </p>
<p>This is a hypercompetitive and materialistic world and you're a talented developer in a city full of them. But do all that and you'll keep abreast of those that don't, and eliminate a large chunk of the competition. Because if you become complacent, your time <em>will</em> come,  <em>you fat, bearded, cheetos-eating, Dr. Pepper-drinking, World of Warcraft-playing, nose-picking and snot-eating motherfucking fuck-shit</em>. This is a global depression we're living in. Employers have become more selective so if you don't want to die in a cardboard box, you'd better do as I'm telling you.</p>
<p>And when you're made redundant at 55 and can't find another job because you're overqualified and can be replaced by someone with half the experience and money, you'll wish you had spent some of that time going out more often, making friends and finding a girlfriend.</p>
