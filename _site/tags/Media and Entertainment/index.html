	  </header>
	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>It has come to my attention that a cousin of mine has appeared on Greece's Got Talent and there's a relevant clip on YouTube to attest to that.</p>
<p>They say you should be able to choose your friends but not your relatives. To protect his privacy, no, scrap that, to protect MY privacy rather, I won't publish a link to the YouTube video. I can see his point though; he's a productive age yet lives on the dole and has too much free time to piss about and obviously he got paid to appear on the episode he did. When I was shown the vid with his act, I just knew; I can think up a hundred ways to waste my time but to see a clip of my cousin on Greece's got Talent will actually make me want to invent time travel and reclaim 2 minutes of my life.</p>
<p>The "judges" there are cut from the same cloth as Simon Cowell et al. Talentless yet lucky enough to ascend to showbiz, on the brains department they're no different than the general population and obviously they took a couple of risks in order to get money and fame which turned out to their advantage. Their replacement is standing on the stage before them, longing for their approval.</p>
<p>I won't go on on how talents got discovered before the talent show era. That goes without saying. What I don't understand is why one would make a complete motherfucking cunt out of oneself to prove a point or, for that matter to pass one's time. It's one thing to be judged by examiners on how well you have studied a profession, in which case you can appreciate their judgement and perhaps take no for an answer. On top of that, the examiners will not take the piss on you like Simon Cowell does.</p>
<p>"Quit fucking watching it then", I hear you say. Fair enough. Might I mention that I haven't, in fact, seen one single episode of any of that. That doesn't mean you've just escaped it, no. A member of your family or a friend or an acquintance will be obsessed with it and talk about it. I've had two guys in their mid-30s telling me how gracious Susan Boyle was and that how everybody who judged her by her looks should be ashamed of themselves and oh I was one of those too and I'm so full of regrets now. In short, a type of conversation one would expect only from our girlfriends when they were away from us in a shopping mall while we were focused on the important business at hand, i.e. getting pissed up at the pub at 2pm.</p>
<p>In the recent years we men have been politically corrected like nobody's business. In a sane world, Billy Elliot would have gone to his dad begging him to register him for boxing classes. Britain's Got Talent would be aired on a 4th class cable channel. There would be a variant of Sex And The City with men. See where I'm going with this?</p>

	    <p>I haven't yet found the nerve to tell my mates in Greece to fuck off next time they send me a chain mail of what is perceived as a joke. At the moment I am just content with just deleting the gits without looking inside. Yesterday, however, I received an e-mail with a URL starting with 'http://news.bbc...' on the subject line.</p>
<p>It must be important, I thought. Perhaps Anthony is watching what's going on in this country as the "politicians" are wrecking it and he wanted to bring my attention to something I may have already seen but sometimes you just don't know.</p>
<p>"Taking showers can make you ill", the title read, and the article body went on explaining that your shower head contains "dangerous bacteria" and they make their way to your skin when you take a shower.</p>
<p>That's right. The Bacterial Shower Head is coming to sit next to the Bacterial Keyboard in the Bacterial Hall Of Fame. You remember that one? Yes, it's the keyboard that is n times dirtier than a public unflushed shitter (where n &gt; 2). What was your reaction when you first heard that? Very few people would, I presume, rush off to shed alcohol on their keyboard. Most likely, the reaction of the rest would have been "Fuck them scaremongers".</p>
<p>There is no denying that keyboards accumulate germs, but so does a mobile phone's keypad, a train/bus support railing, a steering wheel, money, keys, especially if you drop them on the ground or the floor. Everybody can deduct that simple truth. And what do we do about it. Jack shit, of course. Me, I can't be arsed. And in any case none of the people I know will ever take off their shower head and immerse it in bleach dissolved in water on a monthly basis.</p>

	  </header>
	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>As I was doing my grocery shopping, those strategically placed colourful magazines caught my eye. Although, honestly, even if they weren't so strategically placed, they could still be spotted from anywhere in the shop being so bright that in the event of a blackout they could easily light up the place. </p>
<p> Imagine being a grocery store clerk and you are restocking the place: "Hey Ngozi, we need to put the latest version of "Heat" next to the till queue area. These old hags who shop here have a memory that fails with age, so let put those mags there to be sure to sell them." </p>
<p> Anyway, there was a big caption in one of them that read something in the lines of "Pete speaks his mind and tells all".  First of all, they assume we all know who "Pete" is. I wouldn't know, if it weren't for his wife (is she still his wife?) whose cleavage stars frequently in the covers of said magazines. I didn't even know that he's a singer. Before I found out, he had only earned the attribute of "the famous guy who has married the glamour model with the big tits". Basically defining him through his famous wife. Pretty much in the same manner as how we came to identify Sharon Osbourne's husband ever since he stopped recording anything of essence. </p>
<p> Basically, it's not a bad thing, having the world know that you shag a glamour model with big tits. Yes, she may be a total airhead. She may be an avowed chav. Yet, it's not a bad thing for one single reason alone. </p>
<p> As the late Don LaFontaine would say, in a world where you're judged by how handsome you are, how much you earn and how pretty is the chick you bonk, you could be the scourge of humanity, an untalented bastard. That means jack shit. Yet you get the big-titted glamour model and become the envy of the male population? All these millions of peasants settle for what they can get while the hottest of the hottest will only look at the likes of pop  singers. That's why they have their faces in the magazines. To remind you where you stand in the social chain and where they do. The personality and how decent the character of their partners are, are not important. They have money and fame and 70% of the world population is looking up to them. </p>
<p> You would think that I'm jealous. For one thing, I know i would never become a pop singer or a model or a footballer. I do the job I think I can do better than any other. Singing is something I'd like to do as a hobby but I don't think it's exactly a rational career to be a pop star or a glamour model so, I've left these two out. What bothers me is exactly the fact that i work just as hard as a performer on european tour, yet I earn 6 times less than he/she does. Of course, I'm not as expendable as they are nor do I have to deal with the circuit of their industries, but still. </p>
<p> The other thing is the wife. How many non-famous men out there can honestly claim that if they could be with virtually any woman that they desire, they would choose to stay with their existing partner? Do we conciously choose the best woman while turning down far better looking women while they would fall hell over heels for us or do we settle for what we can get? </p>
<p> Anyway, those magazines follow the lives of people we don't know and care and who will never get to know what we do in our lives. Yet I suppose they sell a lot of copies. There are two cases at play here. Both apply to those who settle for whatever they can get. 1)They see famous people and their beutiful wives/handsome husbands and live the life they're not living by following what they do. 2) They read their breakup stories nodding their head thinking 'tsk tsk, he got married to a chav glamour model with big tits and silicone lips, what did he expect, did he really think he would keep her or what? At least I'm with my below-average-looking wife who is down to earth, but come to think about it I'd like to do Katie at least once'. </p>
