	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>There were two chav girls on the train yesterday morning one of them yelling on the phone about the barbeque she went to the night before.</p>
<p>Then a lady in her early fifties told her off.</p>
<p>The chav girl hung up and said "It's only you who is moaning, no one else".</p>
<p>"I'm sure a lot of other people feel that way but are too polite to speak up"</p>
<p>Me, on the other hand, while I agree that a lot of other people, myself included, feel that way, they would much rather stay quiet than risk physical confrontation with someone who could carry a blade for all they know. Granted, it was 8:30 am, the two chavs were not intoxicated and didn't look belligerent, but really and truly there's only one way to find out whether they would assault you. And this isn't a place where someone who's not wearing a uniform will come to your aid. So at least the middle-aged woman did test the waters and kind of gave me the green light to show how polite I can be to a chav that I know won't retaliate. Of course, it's not exactly a demonstration of leadership to tread when another has, so I let it slide. The chav promptly got up, followed by her friend, and mumble that she can't be pestered like she's some twelve year old. True. But she can surely be pestered like she's got "pestilence" written across her forehead.</p>
<p>Pros of telling off a chav: they'll think twice before doing it to other passengers in the future because someone is showing them they won't take it. Cons: you can be killed or permanently crippled or your career can be destroyed for killing them and going to prison. Really now, is it worth getting life and having to tell your family that you ended up in prison because someone made you mad? Think about it. Whether the departed was an inbred fuck who would never contribute positively to society doesn't mean much to the court.</p>
<p>So basically I and the rest of the passengers in the carriage chose the right course of action.</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>So what's been happening in the past few weeks. Let's start with my pet hate subject, public transport. The ticker sign on the front and back on each coach pleads us to keep our mobile phone conversations to a minimum volume. To keep them. To a minimum. Volume. Not to make sure that everyone on the carriage knows who you fancy and that you demand to know why that report won't be in your desk in "10-15 minutes when you're in the office". I could go on my phone such as this:</p>
<p>"Alright mate? Yeah, not bad, not bad. I was just dying to know whether you shagged that bird you were talking to on Saturday. You did, eh! Attaboy! Of course she was gagging for it, that much I get. If it weren't for you, someone else would have filled in the slot. So, to business. How many times did you... MOTHERFUCKING GET OUT OF HERE! You shit me not!? Heheh, good man, mate, good man! Just next time remember to give'er one in my favour. Just to honour our friendship. Cool, man, cool. I'll speak to you soon. Bye."</p>
<p>Well, it does sound funny.</p>
<p>The voice over woman who announces the stations the train calls at sounds the same as the voice over woman who announces the bus stop the bus has been requested a stop for and the woman who happily innstructs us to go to our collection point in Argos. I wonder if these voice-over people ever give interviews, same as the woman who did an interview and does the voice-overs for Athens's Metro.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm sure morning's commuters must hate my guts to death when they hear my recorded voice saying that there is a platform alteration to the train which is due in one minute and that 80 people are waiting for. I'm currently living under 24-hour police protection. I mean I don't have it as bad as Geert Wilders or Ayaan Hirsi Ali but still."<br />
I notice fewer of those posters showing two cartoons saying towards the passenger that they will not eat smelly food or that they'll keep their feat off   vacant seats or whatever. To be completely honest, only after seeing those posters did I pontificate whether eating smelly food on the bus or train is a bad practice. After 14 hours in the office or after a big night out you just have to swing by Burger King, fight off a few chav shits who want to get a bit familiar with you and get a juicy quadruple whopper when your train is 5 minutes out. Apparently it is bad etiquette after all.</p>
<p>Speaking of chav shits, I don't think I've seen a poster with an ibred-looking cartoon saying "I will not shout at other passengers or talk to myself or throw chips around". I suppose that files under the "if you become witness of antisocial behaviour please call this number" notice which is very near the other posters. I suppose what they're going to do is chopper in within a minute of your phone call, storm the coach's doors and fire a couple rounds into the chav's chest. If that preferable option is not feasible they have to have cops or rail enforcement officers at the next station or the one next to it shoud they miss the train.</p>
<p>Those of the "antisocial behaviour" exhibitors who aren't reported or escape arrest wind up in a tourist resort in Greece a few months later. Thankfully, hundreds of miles away from my hometown.</p>
<p>Their capital is the Burger King inside Charing Cross rail station. At least their single brain cell is enough of white matter to dictate to them that they should queue for their burger. It is, however, not enough to instruct them that they must not treat the person in front of or behind them as if they're best mates. If you stay away from council flats, which I presume that you do since you are at least articulate enough to read this text, the Burger King in Charing Cross station -( bit more difficult but not impossible) and, finally, Southeastern Rail trains (for many reasons other than this too) then you're in the clear.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that chav behaviour should be met with punitive force and not seen as a disease that needs to be cured.</p>

	  <div class="entry-content">
	    <p>Those "don't assault our staff" adverts are everywhere. For good reason indeed as there are plenty of <a title="We've talked about this before" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/human-wastelands/" target="_blank">subhuman cunts</a> who can't seem to know how to behave themselves. Today I saw another one on the DLR:</p>
<blockquote><p>I spat on a member of staff and thought nothing of it. A few months later, I was arrested.</p>
<p><em>Abuse, Assault, Arrest: Our staff are here to help you. Spitting on DLR staff is classified as an assault and is a criminal offence. Saliva Recovery Kits are now held on every train and will be used to identifty offenders against the national DNA database.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Let's get real here: The staff is not here to help us, they're here to put food on their table and maybe give some directions, although to take the DLR from A to B should be, as Americans would say, "a no brainer". But in any case they do have the right to work without the fear of threats or violence.</p>
<p>But the bottom line of this entry is that I can't for the life of me understand who in their right mind would spit on another human being who at the end of the day are just working their shift and want to get home to their families. Why would someone spoil another person's day like that? Especially in the DLR where interaction with staff is minimal. But apparently there are enough such incidents so that they put up those posters on DLR coaches.</p>
<p>What's next, chavs taking a shit on their palm and throwing it at rail staff?</p>

	    <p>I am convinced at this point that I've got a magnet hidden in my torso that attracts those good for nothing arseholes in public places. If you've lived in London for a reasonably long time, you must have bumped into many of them. Those who want some change to top up their train fare (c' est la vie. Did you not plan your return beforehand?). Those who want a cigarette (go buy your fucking own). And those who are just being noisy.</p>
<p>They will make noise on the bus and on the train. Everytime I come across one of those I can't help but remind myself that in my country this indecent behaviour is a rare occurrence and we would always make short work of those bastards. Here, I decided that there is certain abuse that I can take without protesting if this means that they won't slit my throat with the switchblade they possibly pack. However, if anyone attempts to spoil my day while I'm out with a bird, that will be the end of their days. Either I'll end up in the hospital with knife wounds and a broken jaw or they will.</p>
<p>In the UK people are generally respectful of a stranger's boundaries except for a loud minority which when on the piss makes up for all the times it minds its own business. I haven't run the numbers but by the looks of it the minority is more than 30% of the general population. And a 75% of that bumps into me at night.</p>
<p>If I ever reach the point of beating up one of these nobodies and get a sentence for it, I wonder if I will feel a sense of pride. "Jailed for ridding the world of a pushy good-for-nothing yob", the Daily Star will read in its front page. I'd much rather not find out. In fact it shouldn't be a punishable crime to use disproportionate force to teach the poor "youth" that he/she must respect a man's personal space if this is the only way to get the message. You've got someone who is 1. drunk and 2. irrespectful towards fellow human beings. Two separate provocations that, when combined, ought in themselves to constitute a defence of justifiable homicide.</p>
<p>In public transport stations and hospitals there are mounted signs that read a variation of "We will always press for the strongest possible penalties against those who attack, threaten or abuse our staff". Perhaps this will deter many subhumans from assaulting or threatening staff, but quite a few won't give a toss. I am proposing a new sign that could be mounted on the trains that serve my home-work-home route:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We will always press for the strongest possible penalties against those who attack, threaten or abuse our staff. Also mind you that the J D Rennison takes this train home in the evenings. Our idea of "the strongest possible penalties" is  the same as his idea of "the most lenient possible penalties". But fear not; he only takes this route twice a day, so there's still a good change you won't come across him."</p></blockquote>
