	    <p>When we hear that someone has taken their own life we wonder who it was and that when all is said and done none of us is long for this world, really.</p>
<p>Sometimes instead of the above, we think "fucking hell, I'll miss dinner now". This is when a suicide takes place on a train track on which thousands of passengers will be travelling at peak time. Someone had the audacity to jump in front of a moving train when the rest of us have had an exhausting day and we only have a couple of hours to eat something, talk to the family and then go to bed.</p>
<p>If you think that we are insensitive for thinking that, clearly you don't live in London. And if you do, you probably haven't been living here for long and/or your job is very easy. The kind robots will be doing soon (This isn't mine. I don't know who said that). Listen how it goes for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a cat. A small, fluffy cute pet that provides you with companionship. You like the sight of it and you like stroking its back while you're watching telly, when it's home and not busy banging other cats or chasing mice.</p>
<p>One day you get back home and in the sofa there are two cats, yours and a friend of his. You discover there is no chip implant on its neck so you can't trace the owner. It's fluffy like yours and you think yours can do with a bit of company and since cats are highly independent and they'll be spending much time in the back garden you decide to keep the new cat.</p>
<p>A few days later you come back home to see the place infested with cats. So many cats in fact that you watch your step to not step on one's tail. There are cats on the telly, the sofa, the kitchen the shower, the bedroom. You find all of your decorative chinas shattered on the floor as well as all of the dishes you had placed on the dish dryer the night before. Your curtains have been ripped up and all of your furniture has scratches. In that case it may cross your mind that cats in numbers may be more of a pestilence than companionship.</p>
<p>That's what happens in big cities. I think there's far, far too many humans living in such a small space and we all know what happens to a product's value when the market is swamped with that product. We're pestilence that's racing to outnumber locusts. You see thousands of people every day on the way to work and on the way back. That's why we don't make eye contact with anyone as we enter the train. We don't acknowledge them. None of these strangers means anything to us and we think this city would be a better place to live with a 30% reduction in population. When we hear about a (corporate speak incoming) "fatality on the tracks" and it was an accident we think that were there fewer people in the platform this poor sod wouldn't have tripped over and fallen into the tracks. If it was a suicide... how would you feel if one of the tens of cats that suddenly infested your house decided to stick its paws into a wall socket and end it all? Would you curl in sorrow and wonder what its name was?</p>
<p>I've written about suicide during rush our <a title="Will I get home" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/will-i-get-home/">before</a> but in the past few weeks on two separate occasions I tried to hit on two girls who recently moved to London from the "North" and couldn't believe how desensitised we Londoners are in the face of human tragedy. I told them exactly what you read in the previous paragraphs, if you bothered to look. Did I get laid? You will never know.</p>
