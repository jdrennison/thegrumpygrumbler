  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In case you don’t know, and I will fully understand if you don’t as it’s not any more important than reading that Amy Winehouse snorted blow last night, it’s general election day in Greece on Sunday October 4. In the UK, they have an expression called LibLabCon, short for Liberal Democrats/New Labour/Conservatives, a rather disparaging term for the three major parties claiming British vote, meaning that their policies are not really different, rendering the UK effectively a one-party state.</p>
<p>In Greece, I don’t know if there’s an equivalent term. I think people here still think that the policies of the two major parties are essentially different or they simply keep hush-hush as they kiss some MP’s toes in order to get into a long-term work placement program with no insurance and benefits. This is the fate that awaited me had I stayed here to find work. “Everything is going to be alright”, they said. “You must learn to kiss arse in the right way and at the end of the day it doesn't matter what you know but whom you know”, they said. Thankfully I've rarely been a good listener and got the fuck away sooner rather than postponed my departure until I became too jaded by the daily grind in Greece to emigrate later on.</p>
<p>From what I hear most presidential candidates had had a few broadcasted debates. If they and we wanted to be completely honest, there would be only one debate and it would go somehow like this:</p>
<p>“Opposition Leader, I’ve got this to ask you; The country is in the shit, people have grown desperate and lost all hope in leadership and also generally. What’s to stop 80% of the population to emigrate and deprive you of their tax money?”<br />
“Go on, then, off you go. Fuck off. We’ll import cheap workers from Eastern Europe and Asia to fill in the gap. We’ll also make them citizens and give them the vote.”</p>
<p>And it would all end there as they’re not worth the time of day. Instead, the media give them too much air time putting more important news to the background. As the leaders of the two major parties tour the country, they are on one edge of the country one day, then on the diametrically opposite edge the next day, fresh looking, clean shaven, in well pressed suits. And why wouldn’t they. They never have to do their washing-up, iron their shirts, cook lunch and dinner, or spend two hours a day commuting to and from work squeezed like a sardine on the bus or train. That's left for the people who vote for them. They have all the time in the world to study their speeches, sleep an adequate number of hours a day in their homes or on their jets.They only have to do essential work, which is to please their sponsors continually, and their voters once every four years (or as we said, sometimes every other year).</p>
<p>Now that I mentioned public transport, wasn't there a certain individual named Cherie Booth who boasted on using the Tube to go to work instead or being chauffeured in? I mean, who in their right mind would concede in enduring traveling in such harsh conditions while they can afford a private limo? Obviously she did it to come across as "one of us" but anybody with half a brain could see through a silly stunt like that. In the end she both had to suffer being squeezed on the Tube and came across as a  hypocrite. Besides, I'm pretty sure all she did was to walk from Downing Street to as far as Westminster or Charing Cross tube and travel a couple of stations away. Her protection detail which I'm assuming consisted of at least 2 men, would also take up valuable commuter space inside the confined tube carrier during rush hour, but wasting commuter time is not a crime and if it were to become one, her husband would only vote to make it one only after his Cherie got sick and tired of a whole week of using public transport.</p>
<p>I think the only solution for this country is for us to import a detail from the "LibLabCon" crowd and boot out our own candidates. The British can keep the good ones and send us their useless shits if they like. They can put this house in order.</p>
