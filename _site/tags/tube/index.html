  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>When we hear that someone has taken their own life we wonder who it was and that when all is said and done none of us is long for this world, really.</p>
<p>Sometimes instead of the above, we think "fucking hell, I'll miss dinner now". This is when a suicide takes place on a train track on which thousands of passengers will be travelling at peak time. Someone had the audacity to jump in front of a moving train when the rest of us have had an exhausting day and we only have a couple of hours to eat something, talk to the family and then go to bed.</p>
<p>If you think that we are insensitive for thinking that, clearly you don't live in London. And if you do, you probably haven't been living here for long and/or your job is very easy. The kind robots will be doing soon (This isn't mine. I don't know who said that). Listen how it goes for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a cat. A small, fluffy cute pet that provides you with companionship. You like the sight of it and you like stroking its back while you're watching telly, when it's home and not busy banging other cats or chasing mice.</p>
<p>One day you get back home and in the sofa there are two cats, yours and a friend of his. You discover there is no chip implant on its neck so you can't trace the owner. It's fluffy like yours and you think yours can do with a bit of company and since cats are highly independent and they'll be spending much time in the back garden you decide to keep the new cat.</p>
<p>A few days later you come back home to see the place infested with cats. So many cats in fact that you watch your step to not step on one's tail. There are cats on the telly, the sofa, the kitchen the shower, the bedroom. You find all of your decorative chinas shattered on the floor as well as all of the dishes you had placed on the dish dryer the night before. Your curtains have been ripped up and all of your furniture has scratches. In that case it may cross your mind that cats in numbers may be more of a pestilence than companionship.</p>
<p>That's what happens in big cities. I think there's far, far too many humans living in such a small space and we all know what happens to a product's value when the market is swamped with that product. We're pestilence that's racing to outnumber locusts. You see thousands of people every day on the way to work and on the way back. That's why we don't make eye contact with anyone as we enter the train. We don't acknowledge them. None of these strangers means anything to us and we think this city would be a better place to live with a 30% reduction in population. When we hear about a (corporate speak incoming) "fatality on the tracks" and it was an accident we think that were there fewer people in the platform this poor sod wouldn't have tripped over and fallen into the tracks. If it was a suicide... how would you feel if one of the tens of cats that suddenly infested your house decided to stick its paws into a wall socket and end it all? Would you curl in sorrow and wonder what its name was?</p>
<p>I've written about suicide during rush our <a title="Will I get home" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2010/11/18/will-i-get-home/">before</a> but in the past few weeks on two separate occasions I tried to hit on two girls who recently moved to London from the "North" and couldn't believe how desensitised we Londoners are in the face of human tragedy. I told them exactly what you read in the previous paragraphs, if you bothered to look. Did I get laid? You will never know.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Over the years I and many other Londoners have been inconvenienced by tube closures during the weekends, except the summer of 2012 when it also happened that very few of us actually cared to use it.</p>
<p>When commuting to work it sometimes breaks down. When you want to go out and pull someone, they close whole sections.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_344" align="alignnone" width="802"]<img class=" wp-image-344 " title="Tube closures" alt="Planned engineering works for the weekend. Everything will be closed. We thought to rally the troops and fix a bit of everything. Really, why do you want to go out this weekend anyway? People will be fighting everywhere and you may get caught in the middle. Also, we know and you know there's no chance of you getting hooked so there's that too. Whatever, just wait until we're done." src="/assets/tube4.jpg" width="802" height="535" /> It took me more time to find a good tube map photo than think up the punchlines and add them to it.[/caption]</p>
<p>They say the works will take <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18072.aspx">as much as 10 years</a> to complete. It's already been going on for 10 years, so it'll be 20 years when it's all done. With the advancements in engineering and technology the bits they did first will be pretty much old by the time the projected end-of-engineering-works date will arrive. But I guess as long as they're not the "break-down" type of old, everyone will be fine with it.</p>
<p>Realistically, if there's one thing that will give the Tube more than the estimated 30% capacity, that would be cutting wider tunnels and have wider trains running in them. The cost of it is prohibiting and if they were to go ahead with it they'd close parts of the tube for months or years on end. Instead, they're solving the problems of today and 80 years down the road the tube will need yet more "improvement works" and they'll be closing parts of it again until 2120.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/18072.aspx#qu1">A very good FAQ section on the TFL website.</a> One of the things that will be different is that there will be air-conditioned trains when it's all done. Still no mention of being able to use a mobile phone. Last time the train came on top I remember I was so elated to get a signal to access the internet, I thought I was going to die if I couldn't read my feeds for another 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Also, no mention of any plans to deal with drunk fucks on Saturdays.</p>
