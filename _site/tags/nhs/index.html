  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Today I called NHS Direct to complain about a heart discomfort. I guess what I really wanted from them was a bit of reassurance, or a standard "Go see your GP" response and not for the call centre nurse to act all worried and insisting to call an ambulance to my work address.</p>
<p>"The symptoms you described to us look more like a case of an imminent heart failure and we would like to have you checked".</p>
<p>Heart failure... yeah, I knew those 14-hour work days would pay off some day. Well, if she's going to make us lose money at work by me not being there, I'd much prefer to save the minicab money and get chauffeured to the hospital in a large cab, courtesy of the NHS.</p>
<p>"I can still rush to casualty afterwards, someone else might need that ambulance more than I do, that's not a problem", I offered instead.</p>
<p>She repeated the same sentence she said before only with a different wording. When I was checking my symptoms on the netty I was worried enough to picture my desk with a wreath on it, so I decided to go with her suggestion.</p>
<p>One of the paramedics had earrings on both his ears and the other one was a redhead bird in her mid 40s with a large tat on her wrist. Imagine that. In most waiting job adverts they're asking for non-visible tats or piercings. Personally I couldn't care less if the waitress in Strada or Pizza Express has a few tats on her forearms but what sort of trust would two paramedics with tats and piercings inspire on you? I guess that's a government thing, that we mustn't be judgemental about someone's class, or ideology or creed. Moreover, it's a good thing that these people have found this thing to do, help other people in serious need, that is. If it hadn't been for that they might have be doing something else I'd much rather not know about. It almost brought to my mind a heated conversation my mom had with my little brother back in 2004:</p>
<p>"You haven't done a day's study in your life and you haven' got any qualification. Will you ever open the paper and look at the jobs section? There is an opening for ambulance drivers. Decent money," she had then said to my devil-may-care brother.</p>
<p>"Like fuck I'll be driving screaming, blooded, dying people around the town, mom!"</p>
<p>"And just what do you plan to do with your life? We all have to do something!"</p>
<p>Being a paramedic is not an easy thing, considerign also the abuse they must be taking from human wastelands, so I'm glad these two people turned their lives around like that. If they ever read this, I'd like to offer the my apologies for not taking the time to thank them for the good job they did today.</p>
<p>"Was it you who called for the ambulance?" the female paramedic asked me while the guy was taking my blood pressure and measuring the oxygen in my blood.</p>
<p>"It was in fact the nurse I was talking to on NHS Direct"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, I should have known it was the NHS Direct. It's a phone. They can't examine you. We do. They want to call an ambulance even if you've began to sneeze. They're scaring everyone these days. 'A <em>chest pain is your body</em> saying call 999'. So everyone calls 999. Now, we've got the other advert about strokes. You know, the one with someone with a fire inside their head. I know they're trying to help people, but they end up frightening everyone."</p>
<p>Hey, good job, madam. Maybe I should make you a contributor to my blog. I'm no big fan of NHS direct but they're only a phone call away, compared to one's GP, whose availability must coincide with yours and that may happen at best no earlier than in two weeks time.</p>
<p>But she was right. If you're anything like me, the stroke advert should have made you utterly paranoid and constantly on stroke-watch. There are three chief symptoms you should watch out for in order to save lives:</p>
<p>1. Difficulty smiling</p>
<p>2. Can't lift their arms up</p>
<p>3. Slurred speech</p>
<p>Pretty much fits the profile of everyone I see on the train to work every morning. This is a pandemic that gives the swine flu a run for its money.</p>
<p>Maybe not so. There was no fire in their foreheads, so they fortunately got away with it.</p>
<p>As we were driving to the hospital, the female paramedic was asking me some demographic questions and was making notes.</p>
<p>"Is that information really necessary? Why do you need to know all this?"</p>
<p>She gave me a frowning look. "We do paperwork for each case," she said with contempt. After a long pause she added that she had asked for my next of kin's phone number should I die of complications. I said to her that's why I gave her the phone number of my family back in Greece rather than my flatmate's or some other acquaintance's here.</p>
<p>Then she went on harping on the nothing cases they had been called to attend to. A girl having her first period ever. A broken nail. I didn't know someone would receive an ambulance service for cases like these. "Oh, everyone is entitled to an ambulance service these days", she exhaled.</p>
<p>"But don't they tell us all the time that if we can make our own way to the hospital we should do so rather than call..."</p>
<p>"Oh we've tried that, nobody listens. We've even distributed leaflets that show an ambulance next to a minicab. That way, people might get to know what each looks like".</p>
<p>Indeed she should be a contributor here.</p>
<p> At that point I wanted in fact to change the subject and tell her that my last date was her age and had a tat of a snake just above her butt-crack but a) only half of this is true and b) she might not have appreciated it much. </p>
<p>We drove past a roadblock near Whitechapel. "Here, look, someone got hit by a car. If we  hadn't had to transfer you to the hospital we would have been called there now."</p>
<p>"C' est la vie. But I wouldn't want to be the car accident victim. Or could it be a gunshot victim?"  I said.</p>
<p>When we got to the hospital, I was immediately received by a doctor. Let me mention here that I've been to the A&amp;E before. In fact I go everytime I have an episode of hypohondria and feel that death or permanent disability may be looming faster than an appointment with my GP. And in the A&amp;E they treat you like a half-wit no matter who you are or what you do. I suppose they have an equal opportunity policy and must speak to each patient in the same manner, regardless of the patient's colour, creed or class. Good for them.</p>
<p> He took me to a bed and asked me a series of questions. Does it hurt when he presses here or there? Does the pain get worse when I lift up my arm making a circle? Good question. Let me concentrate on the pain and see if it is as he says.</p>
<p>"Listen, mate, and listen good, I've got five minutes to decide if your case is a serious or a non-serious one. It can be your heart failing or it can be something as simple as a strained muscle. These five minutes will mark the difference between your waiting one hour to see one set of doctors and four hours to see another set of doctors. It's very important that you follow my instructions."</p>
<p>I never disputed that for a second, actually. Imagine him, he must have been there for five hours already dealing with nutters like me and his patience threshold must have been exceeded. But perhaps he should have spared himself those five minutes and put me in the 4-hour queue straight away, just to be sure. And -surprise, surprise!- I was sent to go through the 4-hour process.</p>
<p>Well, what do you know! I was sent home with some painkillers with the doctors having ruled out the worst. That's what the attending doctor said to me: medicine is a science of exclusion. Yeah, I pretty much figured that out ever since I registered with a GP in this country. Now the next part is to face my boss tomorrow, who has started to suspect my case of hypohondria and will harp on the money that I've made him lose. Or shall I just tell him that this is all his own indirect fault?</p>
