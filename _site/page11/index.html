    <p>What did I learn from going to the Clapham Common fireworks display and missing it? </p>
<p> Up until a few years ago, every single time I took the metro or overground train and my mum was with me, as soon as we got on the train she would always point to a couple of empty seats at the back and go "look there's one over there, hurry, sit down!". I'd never do that. I don't know why, but I was always very relaxed about it. Perhaps I thought standing would be a good exercise or was even feeling sorry for those elderly people who were mixing with daytime workers on the coach. Although, just like pregnant women and buggy pushers they shouldn't be really mixing with the productives during rush hour, I would think "eff it, they're here now so". My mum would wait until I went for the seat and when I said "no mum, you sit, I'm fine standing" she would make a face when someone else would ultimately go sit on the once empty seat. </p>
<p> Things are different now. Senior citizens in London know better than taking the train at rush hour. The same can be said of pregnant women for the most part, but not of proud mothers with buggies. And my compassion has diminished ever since I was introduced to the daily grind. You want me to move down the train? Tough shit, get the next one which, by the way is running as close as 30 seconds to this one, so there is no reason to hold up this one for a good 3 minutes just because everybody has to get in. Don ask us in that patronising/mistress tone to move down the train. You know what, people don't mone down the train. They make faces and ignore you. We all hope that you'll give up and wait for the next train which, if I haven't mentioned it already, is 30 seconds behind this one and is waiting for our one to leave so it can enter the station. What part of "this train is now ready to depart" are you having trouble understanding? Good people have missed a good fireworks display cos of some bitches who weren't waiting their turn. </p>
<p> That's how come I stopped caring. Everyone of them is just a number. I will push to get on the train. I will not show signs of chivalry when I see an empty seat. Here it's every man for himself. </p>
<p> When British Rail and the Tube were first introduced they must have been such pioneering achievements. Multiple levels above or below ground, with signs that even someone with the brain of an amoeba can't get wrong. No amount of improvement, however, can cope woth the ever increasing London population. </p>

    <p>"Enjoy sitting on that train every day?" the huge sign draped all over the new apartment complex asks us. Said apartment complex is right next to a wide band of railroad tracks.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, the train isn't that bad. It might not work often, but it's spacious and your mobile phone works. In fact I spend a lot more time changing to the (aptly nickamed) Tube and continuing my journey once in zone 1. If there was a poster at the platform advertising a new apartment complex with the tagline "As if working for 'the Man' isn't bad enough, why do you do this to yourself and become a fucking sardine twice a day" that may have affected me enough to hunt high and low for a mortgage.</p>
<p>In fact, it's not our commute those adverts should be focusing on. Commuting to work is only a byproduct of the bigger picture which is that we still have to work. However, I somehow think that "Enjoy hitting numbers on that PC 10 hours a day?" wouldn't be an incitement to buy a flat near the financial district, but rather seems like a question a bookie with balls could ask us.</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>It has come to my attention that a cousin of mine has appeared on Greece's Got Talent and there's a relevant clip on YouTube to attest to that.</p>
<p>They say you should be able to choose your friends but not your relatives. To protect his privacy, no, scrap that, to protect MY privacy rather, I won't publish a link to the YouTube video. I can see his point though; he's a productive age yet lives on the dole and has too much free time to piss about and obviously he got paid to appear on the episode he did. When I was shown the vid with his act, I just knew; I can think up a hundred ways to waste my time but to see a clip of my cousin on Greece's got Talent will actually make me want to invent time travel and reclaim 2 minutes of my life.</p>
<p>The "judges" there are cut from the same cloth as Simon Cowell et al. Talentless yet lucky enough to ascend to showbiz, on the brains department they're no different than the general population and obviously they took a couple of risks in order to get money and fame which turned out to their advantage. Their replacement is standing on the stage before them, longing for their approval.</p>
<p>I won't go on on how talents got discovered before the talent show era. That goes without saying. What I don't understand is why one would make a complete motherfucking cunt out of oneself to prove a point or, for that matter to pass one's time. It's one thing to be judged by examiners on how well you have studied a profession, in which case you can appreciate their judgement and perhaps take no for an answer. On top of that, the examiners will not take the piss on you like Simon Cowell does.</p>
<p>"Quit fucking watching it then", I hear you say. Fair enough. Might I mention that I haven't, in fact, seen one single episode of any of that. That doesn't mean you've just escaped it, no. A member of your family or a friend or an acquintance will be obsessed with it and talk about it. I've had two guys in their mid-30s telling me how gracious Susan Boyle was and that how everybody who judged her by her looks should be ashamed of themselves and oh I was one of those too and I'm so full of regrets now. In short, a type of conversation one would expect only from our girlfriends when they were away from us in a shopping mall while we were focused on the important business at hand, i.e. getting pissed up at the pub at 2pm.</p>
<p>In the recent years we men have been politically corrected like nobody's business. In a sane world, Billy Elliot would have gone to his dad begging him to register him for boxing classes. Britain's Got Talent would be aired on a 4th class cable channel. There would be a variant of Sex And The City with men. See where I'm going with this?</p>

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I truly wish for no more plane crashes although we all know they will happen. Every time I'm on a plane and especially at the time the plane takes off, I have that notion of what I must do in case I'm up there and something bad happens. We'll hear the captain's voice on the speaker and he'll say something along the following lines: </p>
<p> "Ladies and gentlemen, I must inform you with regret that the luggage compartment has been decompressed and we are losing oxygen. Also, debris from inside the luggage compartment have been sucked into both of the aircraft engines and we cannot keep up the aircraft. There is still a chance we can get out of this alive as long as you remain seated with your seatbelt fastened and brace when you are told to do so by the cabin or the cockpit crew. I will not lie to you; the chances of our survival are very slim but we will do everything humanly possible to land you safely. Thank you for your understanding and wait for further instructions." </p>
<p> Would many people remain in their seats if that announcement were to be made? I know that in very few occasions people have survived plane crashes and I  would  probably do as the pilot said. Part of me, though, wants to find the strength to defy the crew's instructions, quickly look around the cabin to find a pretty female and approach her with the ultimate chat up line a-la Airplane: The Movie. </p>
<p> "Hi there. You know, it's quite likely that these are our last moments. I've noticed you from a few rows behind and I find you quite cute. Mind if I sit next to you for a while? Though we'd better be quick. By  the way, and i'm talking to you, you old whore sitting next to her, you are ousted to the fucking aisle". </p>
<p> I wish I, and everyone else on the planet, will never find ourselves in that situation. Just in case, though, if you've spotted a single person you fancy in the boarding gate try and see where he/she is going to sit in the cockpit and sit next to him/her. Failing that, once you get into the aircraft scan the already seated passengers. That'll save you a trip to his/her seat, thus inconvenience nearby passengers in their last moments. </p>
<p> You can always ask a steward/stewardess, of course. That applies mostly to us men as there is always at least one tasty stewardess on the plane. </p>
