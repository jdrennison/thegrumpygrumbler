      <p>Let's talk about being a man. A real man, that is. Let's bring up those things that separate the real men from the effeminate ones, the boys and the metrosexuals. Let's praise real men as these are depicted in a Boris Vallejo fantasy painting.</p>
<p>A real man never finishes all of the milk from a bottle in the fridge. He will always leave a tiny bit in the end for use in his morning coffee or tea. The real man will only be using a fraction of the available quantity each time he needs milk for his beverages now matter how little that is and therefore the amount of theÂ milk left will asymptotically be reaching its depletion. Only the use-by date can act as a cut-off date.</p>
<p>A real man never drinks shandy. Seriously, have you seen anyone walk into a bar in a fresh haircut and a nice suit, walk up to the bartender fixing his sleeves and say "hit me with your best Forster's shandy"? If you want to drink shandy ask your girlfriend or one of the females in your group to order it when it's her round. Right? Wrong! It was a trick question. Now get out of my face!</p>
<p>A real man has done a shampoo mohawk in the shower.</p>
<p>A real man doesn't like the word "male". Ladies, use synonyms.</p>
<p>A real man won't look away if a scantily clad woman notices him checking her out. She's having her assets on display. What has the real man got to be embarrassed about? If you're dressed like a slapper you'll be treated like one. You know motherfucking well what I'm talking about. If yoh wear a wide belt you think is a skirt and show cleavage don't then wonder why you can't find a man who likes you for who you are.</p>
<p>A real man always takes a long, hard look at the product of his last bowel movement and exhale in admiration before he reaches for the flush button. It looks like last night's pizza didn't go to waste after all.</p>
<p>A real man only knows the following colours: red, white, blue, green, yellow, brown, black. Ecru, lilac, fuchsia, turquoise and other shit like that simply do not compute.</p>
<p>A real man never takes "selfies". Seriously, that vain fucking shite needs to cunting stop. It was better when they did it when selfies were not yet called selfies but now it's like they're coming out of a fucking cloning tank. They think that men want to be them and women want to be with them. What we really think is "what an attention fuckin' whore".</p>
<p>A real man has attempted to sneak a fart by on a first date. Not always successfully but attempted it he has.</p>
<p>A real man drives manual. I don't want to hear about it. When it comes to driving, it's manual or nothing. At least in the UK the majority of cars are manual so at least there's that. Also, a real man will slip it from three to two just to get off by listening the engine roar.</p>
<p>A real man will sometimes slam an electronic device when it stops working. It doesn't matter if your smartphone is a sensitive electronic device with thousands of ultra-large scale integrated circuits and no moving parts. Just slam it on the side. What have you got to lose? I won't forget how that worked in the case of my tablet. I dropped it on the ground from lower back label and when I turned it on the screen showed gibberish. It would then continue showing gibberish no matter how many times I turned it off and back on. Then I said "fuck it" and let it drop on the floor again. That fixed it. Maybe this snapped a capacitor back into one of the soldered holes it broke off from or something. In any case. If you're a real man you've smacked things that stopped working, from a PC to a smartphone and, if you're my age or older, a CRT monitor or two. These actually did work again when you smacked them.</p>
<p><strong>Are you a real man, were you a real man in the past, or do you know someone affected by being a real man? We'd like to hear your story. Are there any other things that inevitably define real men and you believe are left out? Feel free to add those in the comments section.</strong></p>
