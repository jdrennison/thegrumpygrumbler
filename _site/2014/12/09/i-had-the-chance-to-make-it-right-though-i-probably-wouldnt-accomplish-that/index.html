      <p><strong>Dear Uncle JD,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have been in my current role of Senior Developer for a software agency for about a year now. As my job title suggests, I should be someone who makes decisions and also improves the software methodologies of the organisation. But ever since I started working here, I've been adding buttons on web pages, adding fields into HTML forms, writing API calls or adding optional properties to entities on said APIs. I get pressured by project managers to lower my effort points and time estimates because "the client won't like this and may take their business elsewhere" and then insist to take 20% off those time estimates and turn them into deadlines. I'm the sole developer for many projects.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We nominally do code reviews but more often than not they never get done as everyone else is busy with their own tight deadlines. My project managers always push for the quick-and-dirty solution "just for now" so we can get something "out of the door". The result of this is that I lose interest in the work I'm doing and I often cobble something up just to get it out of the way and relieve some stress on me and yet I still stay in the office until 8pm every weeknight. Of course, it goes without saying that we never revisit that old code to make it right, after all, refactoring released code isn't adding functionality and isn't putting food on the table. Instead, we keep adding functionality to the spaghetti code out there and I find myself slowing down and working harder to manually test everything as a result of this. I now think I'm exhibiting OCD symptoms before a deployment to production. </strong></p>
<p><strong>My question to you is this: am I a complete knobhead for not speaking up more often and getting my point across, or just a partial one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Idiotic and dismayed</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Idiotic and Dismayed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I'm fully aware that technical staff such as devs, DBAs and Ops do everything in their power to avoid conflict. We prefer to work with machines rather than people as machines are more predictable and they don't have the downside of a personality being attached to them, though it may so seem every time you're getting an "Object reference is not set to an instance of an object" error.</p>
<p>As technical staff you want to take the "path of least resistance" when it comes to interacting with people who "don't get the code". This often leads to the problems you've described. Perhaps there'll be a little back-and-forth and the PM may make a concession or two but, let's come off it, if we were good with people and were able to get a point across, we'd be PMs ourselves. </p>
<p>After all how many software job adverts have you not seen in recent years where they're asking for people who can communicate with non-technical staff? I mean they've really got a front to ask for this, haven't they? Sure, at the university you've done a lot of by-now-outdated courses that simulated a software team in a company but you knew this isn't real and if it's anything like that when you get your first job, it'll be fine. Well, it <em>is</em> like that at your first job but instead of other clueless second-years you have seasoned 50 year-old project managers wanting things from you so they can feed their families and you can feed yours. That shit is real and there's no denying it.</p>
<p>When you were thinking of responding to their job opening, what else on the job spec? Did it say that you have to be able to meet tight deadlines and work under pressure? If so, they really meant it. They're not actually saying "there'll be the occasional tight deadline but for most of the time you'll be alright" but "you have to release yesterday every day and you'll be managing multiple projects on the same day, alternating every half an hour with people moaning to your PM over the phone". </p>
<p>Nobody said it was going to be easy, my boy.</p>
