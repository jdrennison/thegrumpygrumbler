    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>A few weeks ago I was in a software developer event and one of the speakers gave a talk about communication and understanding among the software development community. In it, he spoke about rules of conduct and how any remarks that refer to, among other things, physical appearance are not ok. You could make a comment that seems perfectly fine to you but soneone upon hearing it could feel ignored, excluded, marginalised. As an example he told us about back in the day when he was working in a team where someone said something that caused another team member on the "large" side some discomfort. The guy on the "large" side (large as in "fat", not as in "tall") later on kind of withdrew from the social interactions with the rest of the team and in the end he would only talk to them when he absolutely had to.</p>
<p>What happened during that eventful meeting? Did someone approach the fat bloke and called him a "fat fuck" to his face? Did he say something about "fat people"? No. Their team was developing a custom suggestive dictionary software for touch screen devices and someone said that with all the mistakes we make typing with our "fat fingers" this application would take off easily.</p>
<p>That's right. The absurdity of this was made fun of in "The Thin Blue Line", where Rowan Atkinson's character jokingly says "The pot called the kettle African American". Just how are we supposed to know what offends whom these days?</p>
<p>In the post about <a title="Everyone was looking away and no one stepped in to help" href="https://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/why-wouldnt-anyone-help/">Fiona Mountford's tube incident</a> I could be called a sexist and that I'm suggesting that if a woman gets treated like that she might have struck the first blow (I wasn't there, she might have).</p>
<p>In the post about <a title="Starfleet officer: “Data is a thing”. Twitter erupts." href="https://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/starfleet-officer-data-is-a-thing-twitter-erupts/">a Starfleet officer being accused of speciesism on Twitter</a>, I could be called an insensitive white heterosexual middle class man who mocks whoever becomes indignant over any racist, sexist, classist or speciecist thing that happens to go through their Twitter feed.</p>
<p>One time we had some issues with a software that wouldn't do certain things in some languages and therefore caused problems for people who spoke those languages. As I was investigating this, my product manager went "fucking foreign languages... why can't everyone just speak English". I just nodded and said "in any case, there are languages other than English and we have to support them". I didn't say "I can't believe you just said that". I didn't feel  ignored, excluded, marginalised.</p>
<p>I wonder how what reception a talk of mine about communication and respect would have had if it ended like this: "We are a community and we have rules of conduct. Any comments about race, religion, sexual orientation and physical appearance are in breach of these rules. Of course if a person on the large size is offended by expressions such as 'fat chance' it's their fault for being such sensitive pussies and if they haven't got a metabolism problem it will not be seen as a breach of the rules of conduct to ask them to reduct their frequent trips to McDonald's and go do some exercise. We're here to create great software and not pussyfoot around words in case someone decides to feel offended for the day. If I say 'big arse method' should I get down on my knees and apologise to people on the large side who just happened to be within earshot? Fuck that."</p>
