      <p>I took advantage of the national holiday that was and headed for the beach.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-557" src="/assets/beach1.jpg" alt="British Beach" width="676" height="492" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">Well, whatever passes for a beach here, that is.</p>
<p>My first order of business was to get to know the town I just found myself in so I took one of the open decked tour buses that seem to be in every city and town in the world. After all, what's a better way to see a new place than have a local tour guide show you around? Then you'll have more time in your hands to have a stroll in the same high street as in your own town, with the same chain coffee shops, the same chain restaurants, the same chain bookstores, when high streets had bookstores. When food replicators like those in Star Trek are made there won't be any coffee shops and restaurants in the high street either. I'm pretty sure that the only thing that would survive are the pubs.</p>
<p>But I digress. Going back to the tour bus, the thing was parked in the town centre and the tour guide was singing something loudly along the lines of "The best way to see the town and the surrounding areas is by our open top tour bus, you'll spend two unforgettable hours on the tour bus"... you get the idea. "I'd like one adult ticket", I tell him. In case he mistook me for a toddler or an elderly man, of course. Then he taps me on the shoulder and says "get on board and we'll come find you, my friend".</p>
<p>He... tapped me on the shoulder and called me "my friend". This is how the people of the countryside differ from those living in London. In London, the longest conversation you would have with a stranger is when you slightly brush them on the tube, say "sorry" without looking at them in the eye and continue on your merry way. Except on a Saturday night that instead of "sorry" the other person <em>will</em> look at you in the eye and say "oi, you got a problem, bruv?".</p>
<p>During the bus tour, the weather went from sunny to cloudy and then overcast and rain. As I got off the bus he, the guide, said "you just know the weather will be bad when there's a bank holiday". The surprise didn't come right away. Firstly, the reminder sank in that on 6 out of 8 public holidays in the year the weather is utter shit. Then there was the suprise. Hang on, what just happened, I thought to myself. He, the guide, a complete stranger to me, was making small talk? He was chatting to me about the weather and that bank holidays like to bring it down on us. I looked at him as though he'd offered to fill my water bottle with some of his piss.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, you have the fewest public holidays in Europe but remember that at least you have public paid holidays. Now you also want clear skies with them? It's all take, take, take with you lot.</p>
<p>- The Man</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me digress once more, because I like to do so. "Bank" holidays. They call them that because banks are closed during that time and therefore do not handle money. If they don't handle money, no other business can work as the bank is the middleperson (P.C. for middleman) in every transaction. So it's the bank's holiday first and everyone else's second, by consequence. If you wanted to know who really runs the place, you didn't have to experience a financial recession to find out. You needn't have seen the media get all worked up about bankers getting bonuses that's twenty times your salary. The name Bank Holiday is indication enough.</p>
<p>So, weather talk. Typically at this time of the year you can't predict the bloody thing. I was wearing a t-shirt, a shirt and a thin denim jacket. Sometimes it was too warm and I had to take off the jacket. The next minute it was too cold. I am normally not bothered by this as I normally look out of the window in the morning to decide what to wear and if the sky is relatively blue I go "fuck it, short sleeve and the leather jacket it is". I can handle the walk to the tube station/bus stop, weather conditions don't affect me when I'm commuting and there's heat or air conditioning in the office. When I go out, only the venue changes. But it's a wholly different story if I'm travelling lightly for a few days in the spring and I'm out and about all the time. Wear a warm jacket and you'll sweat your bollocks off when the sun comes out. Wear a thin denim jacket and your bollocks will freeze when the sun hides behind a cloud layer or when it's overcast. What I've found that works is to get a backpack with clothes that cover each eventuality but you'll have to be carrying with you always since there's a high likelihood you'll need any and all of the packed garments within an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Nightlife</strong></p>
<p>The night is in full swing and on Friday and Saturday some pubs are allowed to trade for longer than during the rest of the week. Great news! So instead of getting kicked out at 11 you're allowed to stay and drink until midnight. If you wwant to carry on drinking you'll have to go to a club.</p>
<p>I've not seen many differences from London, really, apart from the fact that these places must be full of locals every week. You would think you can't afford to get in a brawl as those you were playing "let's punch each other in the bollocks" with the night before you'll see in a restaurant next week when you take out a first date. Just like in London, everything has a bouncer outside because presumably no one can go and enjoy a few beers without getting into a fight with someone. In fact I've seen it so often that I'm now paraphrasing Arthur Clarke's third law:</p>
<p><em>Any sufficiently advanced number of late night drunken incidents is indistinguishable from premeditated attempts to commit violence on behalf of the general populace.</em></p>
<p>So I'm now pretty sure that lots of people before they go out they think "whoa, what a fucking week that was, I just can't wait to go drink six beers and then punch in the teeth the first unlucky sod I cross paths with".</p>
<p>Other sights include long queues to get into a cheap bar and get cheap shots.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-590 " src="/assets/club-queue-e1401923024928.jpg?w=204" alt="Club Queue" width="300" height="441" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">I've queued for far too long to be turned away by you fluorescent jerkin twats. Here's my ID.</p>
<p>I saw lots of girls that would have done everyone a favour if they either stayed at home or inform us where they're going to be spending the night so we won't be going there. And because these days everyone likes to share the innards of their souls on the Internet, I am offering to write an app that aggregates women's status updates about where they're going when they're going out. To be featured in the data aggregation, the woman must have a sufficiently large Kitsch Index, which will be determined by whether she has selfies on her Facebook and Instagram and how much she looks like white trash. Then the data will be displayed on a layered Google Maps map where you can see the trends of the evening.</p>
<p>Seriously. What we see in any given evening cannot be unseen and if our retinas could speak they would beg us "please, no more!" after the repeated rapings they have suffered.</p>
<p><strong>Fancy dress without being out on a hen night.</strong></p>
<p>If I don't see any ribbons around their torso I just assume they're not celebrating their girlfriend entering married life. Instead, I always assume they had thought "girls, what are we doing tomorrow evening? I say we snag some used PVC nurse uniforms from the dustbins outside the Brazzers studio and hit the town!" Nobody finds it sexy or cute. If men are looking at you it's because they're thinking "what attention fucking slappers they are". Seriously, I've never seen anyone busting a move on women wearing fancy dresses at a club.</p>
<p>Moving on. Barefoot fat chick holding her £10 shoes from Missbehaving in her hand. Not sexy. Give it up. Well we're partially responsible for that too. You see, someone like her will always find someone eager to find just another hole to shove his rod through, no matter whether he is in a relationship or not and chances are it won't even be as good. Hugh Grant used to do Liz Hurley and yet elected to mess around with an ugly prostitute. If Hugh Grant did that, imagine the lengths that you'd go to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-605" src="/assets/mainssocket.png" alt="Mains Socket" width="255" height="272" /></p>
<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:center;">Tell me you wouldn't smash that.</p>
