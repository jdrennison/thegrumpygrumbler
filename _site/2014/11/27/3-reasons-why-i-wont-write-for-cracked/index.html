      <p>For the most part, I like Cracked. Sure it's an American humour site and a lot of things on it don't apply to British everyday life but that aside, it provides a lot of lessons in life from people who have been through stuff and seen things.</p>
<div></div>
<p>I've also heard they pay you money to write for them. What the fuck, I thought to myself, I've been doing this blog for five years and it wouldn't hurt to make £63.8092 for submitting a draft. And, if it gets approved by the editors, become a published article and be seen by millions. A few more of these, then move on to a bigger medium, get famous and wallow in £50 notes and pussy.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Seriously. People have done less for the prospect of money and minge.</p>
<div></div>
<p>I decided to look into this further and read into the process. Here's what it looks like, and has put me off.</p>
<div></div>
<h3>1. The article needs to be in the form of a "listicle".</h3>
<p>This is in the FAQ and they're saying that listicles work for them and they got more views since they adopted a "listicle-mostly" policy. But listicles are the articles of the lazy reader, surely? Cracked is the go-to place to be entertained and, of late, educated. You're not supposed to read their articles thinking "so I've read the 5 'horrifying' realities of being a dog hairdresser and they didn't shock me. I hope the other three will". This isn't Buzzfeed or Upworthy. It's, or should be, way more substantial. Do they think people will think "tmfl; dmfr" when they read the things that you do every day without realising makes you a bad person?</p>
<div></div>
<p><em>"So let's see... how many paragraphs remain until the end of item 2? I hope there isn't much left, I'm getting off in two stops, maybe I'll manage to squeeze in number 1. Hang on, what does it say here? There's an unspoken rule that w</em><em>hoever has power over someone else must keep to themselves or they will be forever hated? But we're near the end of the item #2? Why</em> <em>isn't the author expanding on that? Fuck, that's my stop right here. I'll save the damn article for later along with the other advice articles that I've hoarded and will never read, but this one I will read. Why? Because even if it wasn't a "listicle" Cracked writers know how to retain your fucking interest, that's why.</em></p>
<div></div>
<h3>2. They want you to do research</h3>
<p>That's a first. But how about this: I'm not going to research fucking anything. I'd do research for a university paper but this is a comedy site and editors can and do write opinion articles. Apparently they want third parties to do some educational pieces as these take the bulk of the hard work that is required when writing an article from Cracked. That leaves more time for the seasoned staff to write more opinion-based articles while we run around interviewing people and reading journals to present our findings in a comedy-style narrative. In the marketing circles this is known as crowdsourcing which roughly translates as "the people inside an organisation experiment with all the interesting stuff that doesn't generate enough revenue to keep the organization afloat but they get outsiders to do the tedious shit which, however, brings more money to the organization, and give them a tiny cut from the revenue". My argument here is that the most revenue-generating sources are, like I said, tedious shit.</p>
<h3>3.Research isn't required if you have a personal experience that is deemed unique.</h3>
<p>If you've been through stuff that most people haven't, Cracked would like to hear from you. Over the past couple of years we've read on the site stories from someone who've <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_21858_what-its-like-to-survive-point-blank-blast-from-shotgun.html">accidentally shot themselves and as a result got amputated</a>, a woman who was a <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_21538_5-things-i-learned-as-sex-slave-in-modern-america.html">victim of people trafficking</a>, <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20841_5-things-i-learned-as-cop-that-movies-wont-show-you.html">the story of a cop</a> and the account of a retired Delta Force operator who was hunting and interrogating Taliban commanders in the Kush during the peak of the War On Terror. Ok, the last one has never been featured but, who the bloody hell knows, just give it a year and see.</p>
<p>I won't fit into this category either unless they let me write an article called "5 things I've learnt being a software developer in London whose life has pretty much been home-work-home-bar-on-Saturday-night".</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Cracked does take itself too seriously, but, hey, it'd be a good way to make money and get laid like a fucking motherfucker.</p>
