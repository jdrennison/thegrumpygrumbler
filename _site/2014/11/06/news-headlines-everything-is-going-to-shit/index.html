      <p>It's easy to get utterly paranoid if you spend too much time on the Internet or if you often read the rags previous commuters have left on a seat on the tube. However, trust you me, you've not seen anything yet. As people get bored with the same scare stories and the race for readership is only going to intensify in the future where instant global communication will become even faster, the headlines and the (unverified) stories will only become more hideous.</p>
<p>Also, it'll help that we're living in unprecedented times where everything is going to fucking hell quickly. Or maybe not but that's the vibe I'm getting from news outlets. Well, in any case, here are news headlines from a possible future.</p>
<h3>The new YouTube sweetheart is taking the world by storm.</h3>
<p>Susan Deacon, 13, has captivated audiences with her song "I'm waiting for the knight in the shining armour". She's about to be signed with a major record label.</p>
<h3>Pop idol makes young people kill themselves.</h3>
<p>Justin Bieber's latest hit "Don't you wish your bird was hot like mine" has had many young adults slit their wrists in desperation having been reminded that they've just been settling for what they can get all along. They know damn well that being a rich celebrity makes a person better than the rest.</p>
<h3>The most expensive train ticket in Britain costs almost £4000.</h3>
<p>The route from St.Ives to Aberdeen has now reached £3,945 although it doesn't seem to bother the Cornish. "Why would we want to go up there to that dark, moody, rainy place anyway", one of them said. "Them Scots are having their comeuppance for trying to secede. A warm weekend on the beach will cost them dearly so they can stay right the fuck where they are if they don't like us".</p>
<h3>Energy bills have risen by 400% in 2 years.</h3>
<p>"Hey, we've got expenses too" a spokesman said. "We said we'll freeze prices until this year and we did. Now we can no longer absorb the increasing costs. I've already said enough, we don't have to explain ourselves to consumers."</p>
<h3>ISIS fighters are here to kill us all</h3>
<p>According to the latest government figures, an unknown number of people have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS and an unknown number returned to the UK before the media picked up on this story and therefore terrified the government into interviewing returnees from the two countries more rigorously. It is now believed that there <em>will</em> be multiple attacks with tactical anti-matter warheads between now and next week. The country's police forces have dispatched cloaked aerial drones to patrol the capital and other major cities and the Army Reserve has been deployed. The Home Office has raised the threat level to full black and Prime Minister David Cameron has urged the public to drop everything they're doing and remain completely still until everyone in the country is assessed and the suspects are found.</p>
<h3>The damage to the economy is 'irreversible'</h3>
<p>28 million unemployed Britons between 18 and 55 have taken to the streets in protest. The Chancellor has announced there won't be any pensions for anyone as the economy has reached a level lower than the Global Depression's in the 1930s. The only skills that are currently on demand in the country are those of a CEO's, a banker's and a high level politician's.</p>
<h3>Your neighbour has Ebola</h3>
<p>The only reason you would speak to her is to ask her if she would mind turning that hip-hop music down a few notches so you chances are you won't ask her. But she is infected with a rare strain of airborne Ebola. By the way if you haven't seen her at her patio in a while, she may be dead and nobody has yet noticed. It has been speculated that that strain of Ebola can survive outside a host for months and when it feeds on a dead person's cell protein it becomes ten times more airborne.</p>
<h3>Could everyone in the world have all of their online data taken HOSTAGE?</h3>
<p>It has emerged that criminals may be intending to conduct cyber attacks in order to steal account information and data from everyone who is Facebook, Twitter, Google, Evernote or Dropbox, and all the major internet banking systems in the world if they haven't done so already.  If this happens, experts have warned that the data could be sold to the highest bidder for ransom.</p>
<p>"They will know how much money you have in your bank accounts", security expert Steve Mills told us, "and they will probably ask you to cash in all of your assets to unmarked bank notes or all your photos snogging your mistress and the guy from the car part shop will be shown at random on Facebook's or YouTube's home pages when these have their security upgraded and then are hacked again by the same individuals."</p>
<p>Another expert, Troy Hunt, said "I've tried to tell everyone but in one ear it goes and out the other".</p>
