    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>We've seen what lot of good our past and current leaders have done us. If I get enough page views I intend to cash them in and consequently rule this dirty little planet. I think my manifest can be drawn up by excerpts of previous articles but I'd like to mention some things that are gonna change around 'ere once I'm in charge. 'Cos some people currently in charge are just taking the piss, it seems.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is I've found solutions to all of world's problems and while I was searching for them I still had the time to drop by the pub. I'm presenting a few right here.</p>
<h3>A cap will be imposed on airline tickets</h3>
<p>We do like to fly often here in Blighty. Heathrow is one of the world's best connected airports.</p>
<p>The airlines know this and it looks to me that their sole purpose is to take the piss. Watching the airline fares going up and down is like watching the fucking stock market, for fuck's sake. You monitor price fluctuations for the dates you want to fly on to save a few tens of pounds. If you're flexible with your dates it means it's the airlines' decision when you're going on holiday, not yours.</p>
<p>This won't longer be the case once this measure is brutally enforced. It will now be your decision when you want to go to a place with decent weather. No longer will you have to choose between sacrificing one of your 20 days off a year or an extra £150 to get the privilege of going away for a bank holiday weekend. Of course, there will still be supply and demand or, rather, supply. If a destination isn't popular at this time of the year airlines will be allowed to drop their prices but if becomes popular then can rise the prices again but only up to the price cap. This will be dependent on the destination and reviewed every year.</p>
<p>Because fuck me if I have to plan my trip one year in advance just not to pay £500 just to get crammed in a metal construct and emerge elsewhere just 3 hours later.</p>
<h3>Food shopping from high street sandwich shops will become easier</h3>
<p>In a further move to a bigger government, I will simplify the rigmarole of buying a sandwich. Sandwich chains, you know who you are but like I said before, the last thing I want right now is to see my face on a rag because someone decided to get offended. But really there aren't that many chains who don't just take your money and give you a receipt but decide to brutally interrogate you before you can walk away with your lunch. Now that I'm not the benevolent dictator of Earth, I can print out some T-shirts that will read:</p>
<p>Take away<br /> I don't want anything else<br /> I haven't got a loyalty card and I don't want one<br /> I want the receipt</p>
<p>When I was a child, then a teen and later a young adult, the process of getting a sandwich was a very simple one. You'd take a sandwich to the till, you'd give a bank note, you'd get change and then leave the store. This would happen in a small, independent shop. In more corporate chains, they'd only ask you if you want anything else to which you'd answer "no, thanks" and not "If I wanted 'anything else' don't you think I would have fucking asked for it instead of waiting for you to ask me?" because they only follow corporate policy. The people in the front line of the service sector have got enough shit to deal with without some idiotic wanker being smart. Just smile and say "no, thank you" to everything they ask. I remember I was sitting at a restaurant and the waitress who was serving me was what I think looked like six months pregnant. If you can't imagine yourself being horrible to her because it took her more than 30 seconds to bring you the bill, why would you do it to others?</p>
<p>I know about suggestive selling, I used to serve coffee and confectionery myself back in the day. Your server simply follows the business's imperatives and, mark my words, they are spot-checked.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-688" src="/assets/home-server-icon.png" width="256" height="256" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">And if they're don't ask to sell more things they're taken offline.</p>
<h3>Voluntary sterilizations</h3>
<p>In order to raise the average IQ of humanity I figured I had to reduce the procreation of certain types. My earliest measures will include sterilization clinics around the world. Anyone can drop in and have their tubes tied or whatever the fuck it's called in the case of men.</p>
<p>Clearly you wouldn't expect someone to just drop in and get sterlized, right? Me neither. Consequently I decided to add some incentives to attract different crowds. I could simply force them off their homes but may I reiterate that I want to be a <em>benevolent</em> authority figure, not a tyrant.</p>
<p>So, depending on the target group, gifts will be thrown in to entice it, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ticket to the X-Factor Live finals.</li>
<li>The discographies of Justin Bieber, Rihanna, Cheryl Cole and One Direction at the time of operation.</li>
<li>A set of weights and protein powder.</li>
<li>A bicycle and a fluorescent jerkin that reads "one less car".</li>
<li>A subscription to the local tanning salon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we're saved for good.</p>
<h3>Listening to music over a certain volume on public transport will be outlawed as a felony</h3>
<p>At least those wearing headphones and setting the volume to max are <i>somewhat</i> justified. It could be they've become hard-uh-hearin' after having done this for too long. But the wankers that use a mini speaker have absolutely no excuse and it's not worth getting stabbed in the lung for telling them to turn down the volume. They <em>all</em> look like the stabby type.</p>
<p>This wouldn't have been a problem if there were laws in place for such a thing. The first time someone does this will be let off with a warning. The second time will have their music playing device and knives confiscated.</p>
<h3>Centuries will be numbered by the first two digits of the years they contain</h3>
<p>So 1950 will be in the 19th century and not the 20th century. Honestly, I've never understood why we can't do this very simple thing. Every time I'm mentioning a historical event I must make calculations in my head as if I'm calculating Tokyo time. So, 1950, that's the twentieth... no, obviously, it's the nineteenth... oh fuck it.</p>
<p>Not any more. From now on 2014 will be in the twentieth century. Same goes for the turn of centuries. If you went to school or graduated by the late 90s you probably had had a debate with someone about when the millennium really ends. The rationale went like this: since there is no year 0, year 1 to 10 would be one full decade, so the next decade would start on 1-1-11. The "twentieth" century started on 1-1-1901 and ended on 31-1-2000. The current millenium started on 1-1-2001. I know, it's kind of fucked up. If I had invented the calendar this oversight obviously wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>Upon my takeover, I'll introduce year zero and century zero. When invented, the concept of zero was hailed as one of the major turnpoints in science. We're also doing it in programming.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-688" src="/assets/home-server-icon.png" width="256" height="256" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">This is a legacy platform that will take us a lot of money to replace. And change the habits of a lifetime.</p>
<p>That's my position for my next election campaign. I'm also open to suggestions.</p>
