      <p>Technology has penetrated every aspect of our lives. Just to take the internet as a sole example, in the twenty years that we've had it as we know it, life has changed radically.</p>
<p>So at this time and age surely you'd think someone would have built something that just bloody works? 'Cos most of the things I've seen or used don't.</p>
<p>WordPress editor - extra lines appearing intermittently out of nowhere and you can only remove them if you go to plain text view and press backspace or delete over whitespace.<br />
Smartphone - it's got ridiculously slow over the past few months and I had to disable most apps that came with the phone without me asking for them just to give it some extra speed. I also had to manually clear the cache of every working app as the internal RAM was still in critical mass.<br />
Camera - Battery only lasts a couple of outings. Maybe an outing and a half if I make heavier use of it. Also the battery icon only has three indications: Full, One Bar Down and Blinking Red: About To Shut Off.</p>
<p>In fact the only things I've seen have worked consistently as per factory specs for the years I've had them are my mini vacuum cleaner and my stubble trimmer.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img class="wp-image-649 size-full" src="/assets/trimmer.jpg" alt="Trimmer" width="212" height="128" /></div>
<p style="text-align:center;font-size:.75em;">There's actually a set of larger blades that comes with it. I use it to shave my bollocks.</p>
<p>So nice work, us! It only took us fifty fucking years to make a vacuum cleaner and a razor blade work as they should.</p>
<p>In the 50s they told our parents that by 2000 we'll be commuting to work via jet capsules that will be travelling inside tubes that will be sprawling across the city. I remember this envisioned future being told to us by teachers and media In the 80s even, although the "by" year was shifted a bit forward. To this day we've not seen super-tall buildings, spiralling carriageways that go up in the sky and robot taxi drivers.</p>
<p>Yeah, what happened to those, I wonder? You'd think robots would be capable enough these days to ask you your destination, drive you somewhere and then ask for the fare or get out of the car and chase you at superhuman speed should you attempt a runner.</p>
<p>Robots do become more complicated but they're not yet ready for a real end-user application. This is how the history of robotics can be summed up, as this was demonstrated in various university research facilities around the world:<br />
1980: Robot walks on flat surface and avoids obstacles.<br />
1990: Robot walks on a flat surface and avoids obstacles but it's made up of more complicated parts.<br />
2000: Robot walks on a flat surface and avoids obstacles but it's made up of even more complicated parts.<br />
2010: Robot that looks incredibly like a Japanese woman if you watch a video of it in 144p, walks like the robots of the past three decades, raises its hands like a robot of the past three decades and blinks.</p>
<p>The same goes for the web. The internet's scope hasn't changed in the last 15 years, said scope being to search for information, shop and have a wank, but today it's done with large beasts that are programmed in two or more languages. Websites tend to behave as an interactive desktop application. Instead of keeping the same stateless HTTP that drives the whole web and dance around it with cookies and hidden HTML fields and what have you, why can't we upgrade the protocol to allow duplex connection and phase out the existing HTTP? As if this were not all, some companies are treating some web standards as guidelines only and that leaves us poor sods having to code around their non-compliance to those standards.</p>
<p>Recently, Google held a "keynote" presenting its new products. From an end user's perspective they're just the same as the old products only a bit fancier with fancier animations and they're planning to put Android into more things, including wristwatches that can read notifications from your phone. Because, really, that's what was missing from the world. Google finally responded to the deluge of user feedback desperately asking to have a wristwatch that can show a fraction of what an Android phone does, at the price of three watches that can't do that.</p>
<p>What do you mean they had not had such feedback?</p>
<p>Most people who own an expensive smartphone use it in the same manner as they used to use an expensive smartphone before it was called a smartphone: call people, send texts and plan your day with the built-in calendar and task list. Only now they can do it on a 24-month contract. Would any of them go back to a Sony Ericsson K-800? No. Someone told us these old phones are no longer cool and trendy and you need those new touch screen ones with the faster processor and the better animations. I want to show my new S-fucking-5 to my peers, the K-800i is so 2008. And this is in fact where technology has gone wrong. It's become a fashionable thing and has been left to the marketing cocks of business outfits to decide what new gadget we get to see next but if there's one thing for sure it's that at the very least they shove the successor of last year's model down our throats every year. Unless you have £500 to spend on a new fucking "smart"-phone every year you'll probably be replacing it less often but since marketing cocks have convinced you that they seem like they're ten-a-penny, if you drop it and it breaks you'll probably think "well, it's been 13 months, time for a new one anyway. Also a 2014 phone looks more like a 2014 phone as opposed to the 2013 model I bought last year." Silly? Well, evidently it works.</p>
<p>The same goes for us on the producing side of technology. You learn a new way to create a web application that just Creates/Reads/Updates/Deletes records from a database. When you've got a good grasp of it, bam, it's different. Not only did it work before they changed it, it also worked well. Now it's working well but it may have more bugs in it. As far as the end user is concerned unless there's new functionality in an application or significant visual changes they couldn't give a rat's left bollock how it works under the bonnet.</p>
<p>Before you shove all kinds of useless bells and whistles into something, make sure whatever's already there works. Before you put a 12MP camera into the latest phone, it'd help if you kept the 8MP cameras they have right where they are but fix them so they can take non-grainy photos even if we're not pointing them directly at the sun. Compact cameras; same thing. Give us better image quality without noise. I don't know anyone who uses the smile detection feature. Also, the ISO 3200 mode in most, if not all, compact cameras produce photos which are shit but hey let's include an ISO6400 one! But then again the sales department would have a hard time to sell a non-inclusion of new bells and whistles.</p>
<blockquote><p>" We don't have enough time to fix things <em>and</em> add new things before our cut-off release deadline date so in our new flagship model coming out this year we thought we should have existing functionality work better instead of adding anything new. Well, surely the processor is new but we don't make them ourselves anyway. If you have our previous model you surely have noticed that if you take photos in any lighting conditions other than an exploding nuclear bomb you're hard-pressed to tell what those grains in the photo are supposed to make up. So now the camera will produce good photos in sunny and overcast days too and we didn't add extra megapixels. Also we increased the battery life so your new phone can go for over 12 hours without recharging by sticking in a bigger battery and making the phone the size of a brick."</p>
<p>- Advert on new features</p></blockquote>
<p>This loop we've fallen into is perfectly summed up in a cartoon I saw somewhere a few weeks ago where a guy plays a new racing game in his console and his girlfriend says "This looks like like the game you were playing last year" and the boyfriend goes "no that one was Drive Fast 4. This is Drive fast 5." The girlfriend then says something like "so you're racing other cars in Drive Fast 5 just like you did in Drive Fast 4. What's the difference?" and the boyfriend goes "but can't you see the pixel shading in this new one?"</p>
<p>This is a vicious cycle in which our standards are low and corporations don't bother releasing anything above them. Because they don't make anything radical, we become accustomed to and take what they give us without giving much thought to what greatness could be invented.</p>
<p>But no one ever listens to me so you just get what's coming to you really.</p>
