<p>A YouTube commentator who reviews computer and mobile games has found himself at the end of a lawsuit by a video game corporation.</p>
<p>Daniel Hardcastle, commonly known by his alias NerdCubed, posted a YouTube review of a mobile-based puzzle game published by retail giant EA last January where he made remarks on the state of mobile game purchases today.</p>
<p>EA has created a version of game Dungeon Keeper which is free to download and play but requires the user to make purchases within the game in order to unlock certain features which according to Mr. Hardcastle are required to lift some artificially imposed delays during gameplay that hamper user experience.</p>
<p>"The game has received five starts from thousands of people who I'm assuming are all complete and total fuckwits", "If anyone pays for that you're just a fucking idiot" and "I didn't know there are cunts like EA trying to charge that much money for fuck all" seemed to be some of Hardcastle's comments that sparked the legal action.</p>
<p>"This is a smear campaign", said an EA spokesperson. "If our practices were unethical or illegal there would have been arrests of some board members. No one has been arrested. In fact Dungeon Keeper has been received well by mobile users. Not everyone may like the game, of course, but those who don't simply do not download it. For most people it ends there but not for Mr. Hardcastle."</p>
<p>"Also, we have lost 0.6% in earnings since the video was published. We are holding Mr. Hardcastle entirely responsible."</p>
<p>"Then we'll come for Jim Sterling from the Escapist."</p>
