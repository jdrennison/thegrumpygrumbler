<p>Iceland. It's far away, it's small we don't hear about it often. In my mind, it was a place to which I hadn't given much thought but I had it at the back of my mind as a weekend destination. In short, it was up there and we left it alone and it did likewise.</p>
<p>That was before the volcano. I suppose you can see where I'm going with this. I thought volcanoes existed only in fiction. I had seen one or two in the Smurfs back in the 80s, I've also seen "Volcano" and "Dante's Peak". And I thought that was the end of it. Alright, volcanoes exist but it's not every time one erupts that wrecks a continent's airspace.</p>
<p>I haven't written anything here for a month and it would probably be two months if volcanoes didn't just decide to blow up just three days before my holiday abroad.</p>
<p>Fucking volcano, man. Can you fucking believe it.</p>
