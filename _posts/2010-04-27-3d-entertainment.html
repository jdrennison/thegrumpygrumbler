<p>Yesterday I watched Avatar in 3D. This isn't a movie review. I just want to write a few words about the 3D "experience".</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned time and again, those of us who grumble at the slightest distaste of anything aren't necessarily miserable and "down" all the time. Quite the contrary. It's just that we are very sensitive to anything that doesn't feel right.</p>
<p>So when a young woman started addressing us before the start of the movie, I just thought "Really now, how hard is it to watch a movie? What's so different about this one that some busybody in the board of directors has decided that we need instructions?" She went on to tell us that mobile phones are prohibited in the theatre. That's very comforting. I don't really know if IMAX employs bouncers but I'd love to see what'll happen if a phone rings one day. It will probably just cause the dismay of other viewers.</p>
<p>The usher then goes on to tell us not to put on our 3D glasses and that there will be an automated message telling us to do so. She didn't tell us if it's prohibited to do so before we hear the automated message. I love it when they treat us all like invalids. I'm sure everybody who can afford to go to the pictures with Â£15 has enough of a mental clarity to tell if the projection in front of them is 3D or not. At least the bloke behind me said that the trailer that was shown immediately afterwards was not 3D, although it was shown after the proverbial automated message.</p>
<p>The actual 3D was indeed impressive. It seemed like Sam Worthington was a few metres in front of me. Last time I had seen something like that with people in it was in a 3D cinema in Trocadero in '98. They only had the resources to produce a 20-min movie back then, with almost non-existent plot and solely focusing on the 3D impression. Yet apart from this and some scenes where they were trying really hard with the plantation, the rest of the picture seemed quite flat, really. I think that technology's still got a little way to go. And it would be nice if we didn't need glasses too. It's a particular pain in the bollocks (or the clitoris) for those who already have their own. I must have tried for about half an hour until I found a position that is comfy for the nose and the glasses keep away from my own glasses' lenses. Wouldn't you know it, the darn things tend to get scratched when they're weeks past the warranty.</p>
<p>Might I now mention that Stephen Lang is the man.</p>
