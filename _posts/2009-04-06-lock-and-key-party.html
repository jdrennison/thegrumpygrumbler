<p>I went to a private party yesterday. In a nutshell, what this thing is, is a singles’ event that takes place in a fancy lounge bar and all the men walk around wearing a key around the necks and all the women wear padlocks and they all have name tags on. The key (couldn’t resist the pun) is to match the lock with the correct key but in essence it’s all about getting singles to meet. To cut the long story short, it’s your typical night in a bar, only in this one you look like a member of staff in a gig venue.</p>
<p>I’m generally not good at dating, I will admit. I’ve been to one of those before, met that woman, went on three dates with her before we stopped seeing each other. Before that, there was that speed dating thing two years before where I had a vibe with that Russian woman but I was so pissed up that I thought i may say something I shouldn’t.</p>
<p>I booked the ticket about two months ago in order to be benefited by their ‘early bird saver’. A fat lot of good it did me.  What seems a good idea two months ago seems nothing but an inconvenience today as a lot of things could potentially change over the course of two months. For one, you could have met someone but let’s not go there now. At the end of the day I thought ’sod it let’s go’ and went. I only bothered to turn up 2 hours after the opening time.</p>
<p>Compared to the other lock and key parties I’ve been – ‘cos I generally enjoy going to them – there was something different about this one. Could it be that there was disproportionality between men and women (with the men being more) or maybe even something about the people themselves. When I got there everyone had already made new friends or flirting and such. Makes you curse for not having brought in a “wingman” with you. Not that I haven’t tried that but apparently my mates have better things to do.</p>
<p>I’ve discovered that we men make a hard sell of ourselves when in bars. There is a limited time frame, you’ve got to make split second decisions before the taller, more handsome bloke goes for the bird you’re eyeing. The hard work falls on you, my man. Women, on the other hand, have it easy. All they have to do is just show up and if they are the least decent looking they’ll have numerous single horny guys flock to them.</p>
<p>In the end I knew well where this was going. No woman would want to be with a “lone wolf” someone who is continuously scanning the area to find a woman who isn’t talking to a man in order to move in for the kill. I pretty much ended up in a line of poor sods standing in a corner, working out their probabilities.</p>
<p>That sort of social pressure I have felt upon me since time immemorial. The message is, you can’t just bloody go to a bar or club and leave at 3am empty-handed. That just doesn’t work that way. This is what we were taught by movies, magazines and what have you.</p>
<p>I think the part of initiating conversation with a woman in a bar should be excised. In an ideal world you would just approach a girl and say “hi lovely, fancy a bonk?” and it would always work. Everything else is bollocks. She knows you’re attempting to pick her up, so that would save you, and her, the time. Besides what’s to talk about beyond “how are you finding it so far”, profession and the like? I find conversations with blokes far more interesting but the problem is I only like women.</p>
<p>Time spent on the venue: one hour, ten minutes.</p>
