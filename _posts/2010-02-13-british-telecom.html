<p>I phoned up BT to talk about my broadband connection which was never activated. That wasn't the first time I called them for the same reason. The first time I tried they promised they'll let their order management department know about my siuation and someone will ring me on my mobile. Never happened. The second time, I got redirected to every conceivable BT department with many waiting intervals in between. 43 minutes after I dialed their number, my phone's battery died out and I had to leave for work. Which brings us to today.</p>
<p> I spent about 35 minutes hearing that they are sorry, but they "are very busy at the moment" and that my call will be answered "as soon as possible". At least they were decent enough to drop the "your call is important to us" bullshit. Because, clearly, if my call were important to them, they would have hired more staff to keep the call queue shorter. I considered the ringback option for a moment (if the call queue is too long, you can select the ringback option and they say they'll call you back within a hour), but I remembered two occassions a few years ago when I did so and no one deigned to ring me back. So I decided to wait.</p>
<p> So, 35 minutes on, a rather peeved third worlder said something that I didn't clearly understand, not least because I had the phone on speaker and was caught a bit off guard partly because of it, and partly because I thought the sales department was based in the UK.  After much deliberation and many intermissions folllowed by "thank you for staying on the line" - like I have much of a choice - he said that a manager would call me on my mobile within 48 hours. Thinking that the previous case was an one-off, I agreed but I decided to take a shot and ask him what exactly the problem with my line was.</p>
<p> "It's fairly technical and even if I could spend an hour explaining it to you, you still wouldn't understand," the third worlder snaps.</p>
<p> I'll tell you why I didn't snap back "Mate, I work in IT and telecoms so you can take  a shot if you like". First off, you do want to be on the good book of a bunch of third worlders who know where you live. Second, imagine being confined in a chair with space as much as that of an economy class airplane seat somewhere in Bangalore and have a middle class twat half a planet away shouting abuse at you. Third, I believe that most of these people genuinely want to help but they are allowed/have the capability to do only so much.</p>
<p> That happened a week ago and no one called me back.</p>
<p> I dreaded going with TalkTalk or Tiscali or whatever the bloody hell it's called these days, Bulldog, if it hasn't yet gone bust or any of the other small providers as I would trust all of them combined just as I would trust a cat next to my hamster uncaged. With BT I still had a chance since I've been with them three times and have never had problems with them. Granted, their broadband speed is fucking slow but unless I was willing to pay Sky's exorbitant "one-off set up fees" and a TV package I don't need, BT was the next best thing. In fact, there was an article in the paper last December titled "UK broadband slower than Greece". You just know that things are utterly fucked when you hear something like that. Every time I visit family I am surprised by the fast speed a video stream is buffered from the web. The fastest broadband I've had here was with Sky and you can still tell the difference.</p>
<p> "Which are your favourite TV shows sir?"</p>
<p> This is a question I would expect on a first date and not by someone at a call centre. I knew where this was going but I answered regardless. "Yeah, I watch 24, FlashForward... that sort of thing. What is it to you?"</p>
<p> "I'd like to inform you of an offer we have on BT Vision this month only."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not interested."</p>
<p> "May I ask why you're not interested?"</p>
<p> "Oh that's rich. I've already ordered a service from you that isn't working but at least the telly will work and you want my money off that, is that it? There is a very specific reason why I called you guys. If I wanted TV I would have ordered a box already, but obviously this is not the case."</p>
<p> I don't know why I've even bothered. I presume most of these call centre workers get picked off the street and only know how to deal with textbook problems so I normally go easy on them. But this one was fair game. He got even more peeved when I declined his offer and asked me for a reason and I showed great restraint so as not to say anything bad about his country of origin. But in any case I never forget that I'm dealing with a person. A person that none the less at the time of their shift represents a huge cumbersome being that you cannot take on and judging by the horror stories I've read on teh interwebs it will many times play hard to get. Unless you cancel your direct debit and make them chase you for their money. When the Indian told me that someone'll call me within 48 hours and that didn't happen then I knew that they could no longer play me like that. I called them on me day off on Friday when I knew that most people would be at work and I would get through to someone quickly.</p>
<p> Bottom line: I got a new activation date for my broadband. If I don't get it, there's the High Complaints department. Then it's Oftel. Or Ofcom. Or whatever the bloody hell they're called these days.</p>
