<p>Expectedly, average rail fares will rise again early January next year, it has emerged.</p>
<p>For the duration of December this year an endless amount of complaining will ensue on all major newspaper's online comment sections.</p>
<p>"What do you mean prices of things go up?", 29-year-old Lisa Daveson exclaimed. "I've bought this nice two bedroom house in Weybridge that'd cost me £100,000 more if I were to get something similar in Wimbledon. The commute is fantastic as it only takes me about 40 minutes to get to Waterloo and from there another 40 minutes to change three tube lines to go to the office during rush hour. It's fantastic!"</p>
<p>30-year-old City worker Nicholas Overs said: "I moved to Tonbridge where I've bought a three bedroom house for the price of a studio flat in Shepherds Bush. If I catch the train to Charing Cross at 7.12, I can be at the office by 9, after taking the Northern and then the Central line. But now I'm wondering if it was all worth it since it'll be all costing me £100 a year more."</p>
<p>"I'm thinking about remortgaging the house and moving back to London. I miss all the history, the nightlife options and the stuck-up plastic slappers I  used to ogle at when I went out".</p>
<p>Telegraph editor David Anderson said: "All we did was to take last year's article on the subject, change the title a bit, replace the figures and ship it. No one notices and the comments below always count in the hundreds."</p>
<p>"We do the same with the house price articles twice a year and there you have it. For all twelve months everyone's kept uptight and on their toes."</p>
