<p>In part, I understand. I wish we could but this is London, not Amsterdam. So, dear cyclist, congratulations. You've spent Â£500 on a bike to risk getting your brains splattered on the tarmac by a double-decker in the City.</p>
<p>Bicycles are legally considered vehicles and they are allowed to share the road with motorised vehicles. This means we all use a metaphorically two-lane road to move around,</p>
