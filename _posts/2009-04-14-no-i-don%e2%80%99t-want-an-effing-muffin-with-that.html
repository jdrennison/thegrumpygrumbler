<p>In the past year or so, either I go get my daily latte at Nero’s, Starbucks’s or Costa’s they ask me if I want “anything to eat with that”. This, while I hadn’t even so much as glanced at the savoury section.</p>
<p>Truth is, if I wanted a muffin with my latte, I would have asked for “a regular latte and a double choc muffin please”, but I didn’t, now did I? Yet I can see the reasoning behind this. I almost always respect other people’s jobs (except if they’re council jobsworths) but on this one I can identify since  because I also worked in a coffee bar for some time. The story is that your boss explicitly instructs you to use “suggestive selling” on customers, that is make them buy more than they came in for. At the time I needed the extra money from that job, so I just went with it. Naturally, customers would most of the time decline but none had ever berated me. I suppose on my shifts I had met all those who respect other people’s jobs and what they have to endure to put food on the table.</p>
<p>I know it’s annoying and the barista treats you like you don’t know what you want, but he’s got a boss too and he is probably watching. Look at the bright side; there is no excuse for them to ask you if you want “anything else”. Picture this, you’ve just ordered your coffee or sandwich or whatever, they take it out of the food stall, put in in a paper bag, wrap it in a napkin and hand it over to you. Then they ask you if you would like anything else to which you always say no. I’m probably not the first person that am asked this question on a particular day. You would think that by now the clerk must have worked out that very, very few people would go to a coffee bar to order a regular cappuccino and a raisin scone but only verbally ask for the capuccino and hold back on the scone knowing that the clerk will ask them if they’d like “anything else” first. Besides, what if the clerk forgets? Well, fear not. In several food chains and coffee bars I’ve lately seen signs which read a variation of this: “if we don’t suggest that you have this or that with your order, you will get your meal for free”.</p>
<p>That should be relieving.</p>
