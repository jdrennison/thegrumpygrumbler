<p>Many over the millenia have wondered which the most despicable type of human is. Some say it's a person who's killed their own mother. Others say it's a cannibal. Others, the man who's skinned his newborn baby alive, put the skin in a blender and then used it as a lube to masturbate over the baby's dead body.</p>
<p>No. In our days, none of these acts is as heinous as using a racial term on someone who isn't of your own race.  The Brigade of PC is gonna get up your arse before you can say <a href="http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-28840210">"dunno, a ting tong from somewhere"</a> and that's it, you're in the shitter.</p>
<p>I didn't mention racism because I thought racism is when you deny someone a job opportunity or want to deprive someone of some civil liberties based on their race. I thought racism is when you think a race should be enslaved because it's inferior. Is Janice Atkinson racist? I don't know and i certainly I cannot deduct any of the above qualifiers for racism only from her saying that a Thai woman is a "ting tong from somewhere".</p>
<p>So here's a tip to use racial terms without the nuisance that is the PC Brigade getting offended on behalf of others: make sure your private comments on someone's race <em>stay</em> private. That is, if you're not sure your mike is off, don't say fucking anything. Also, you have to trust the person you are conversing with not to say anything to anyone but let's assume they just won't. Just make sure you truly are alone.</p>
<p>And if you do get caught just do what everyone else does: beg for forgiveness whether you mean it or not. Why apologise if you don't mean it, I hear you ask and I will answer right away. If we only said things we meant, civility and civilization would collapse before you could respond "Same floor as you, hotness" to the fit chick that was on the lift you've just entered and asked you which floor you're going to.</p>
<p>So if you do get caught say you're deeply sorry you were overheard while making a private remark and next time you do it you'll make sure no one will hear you other than the intended recipients.</p>
