<p>It’s good to have peace of mind in case it hits the fan. Private treatment could cost you thousands of pounds if you want to bypass the NHS waiting lists. In the UK there are a number of medical insurers that take care of this for a monthly fee.</p>
<p>Now anyone who has any type of insurance or is looking to buy one, knows one truth that you won’t see on any medical insurance advice website: most don’t give you a quote online, rather you have to phone them so they can pull a “hard sell” approach on you. And by fuck, are they pushy. Just so you know. It would be just nice to do it all online, comparing the fine print and choosing the policy and company that fit you. Not so. Once you phone a company to get a quote, one of their “advisors” will be out to get you and you’ll have to be cruel to be kind. Even then they won’t give up easily. I wonder what goes down when they receive their training. Their instructor probable gives them clear directives: to keep pestering one’s balls until they buy or say something about them or their families.</p>
<p>That reminds me a of week ago when I had to shoo off a saleswoman whose policy I decided to postpone buying. Actually I thought the only way to be left alone is to tell her that I’m not interested at all.</p>
<p>“Sorry to hear that, is there something that has changed your mind?” she asked. Well, quite a few things, is what I didn’t answer. Such as me giving them an inch (asking for a quote on the phone) and them taking a mile (phoning you repeatedly during office hours and generally think they can be a leech on you).</p>
<p>I’m not saying not to buy PMI, but take your time to compare cos some of these contracts are cunning. You don’t want to chase them for a payment while you’re holding your chest in pain now do you?</p>
