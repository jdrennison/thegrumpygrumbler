<p>I had given Twitter a whirl some 7 months ago. I frankly don't know what had gotten into me. You can only type in 160 characters at a time and if you aren't someone whose day-to-day activities genuinely interest a lot of people, it's only bollocks that clutter up the internet. You only need a blog to bloom your ideas and opinions.</p>
<p>Twitter is good for specific people i.e. someone somewhat known who travels a lot and sees something new every day. For the rest of us, who go from home-work-home or home-work-pub-home every day, I fail to see the importance.</p>
<p>Or do I? Perhaps it is an opportunity for a bitchin, grumblin' grump to express himself in a new way. As I find myself with not much time for blogging these days, as is evident by the sparsity of my updates, I can now mitigate that somehow using twitter. Now, equipped with a Nokia E71, I can make a quick note of anything preposterous I see on the train, the street, or anywhere else, many times during the day, as it happens.</p>
<p>Until I realize that I fail to see any meaning in Twitter after all, that is.</p>
