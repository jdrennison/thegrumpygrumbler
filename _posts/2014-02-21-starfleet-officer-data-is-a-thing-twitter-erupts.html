<p>A Starfleet commander has come under fire after referring to a sentient android as "it" on Twitter.</p>
<p>Commander (OS) David Anderson tweeted last week: "I had the honour to meet Mr. Data yesterday and it showed me around its place of work".</p>
<p>Data, a sentient android who is believed to be the only one of his kind had met Commander Anderson during a Starfleet visit to the Department of Cybernetics in the University of New Sydney where Mr. Data has been teaching since he resigned from Starfleet after his body was decimated in the battle with human clone Shinzon and his CPU and memory boards were transferred onto an earlier prototype on Stardate 56844.9.</p>
<p>"I'm not offended by Commander Anderson's comment", Mr. Data told the Federal Broadcasting Corporation. "It is a well known fact that I'm physically and mentally superior to you humans. I could rule the Earth if I put my wits to work. It's not like I want to do it but I'm just saying."</p>
<p>"I used to want to become human but I take solace in the fact that I can run as fast as a hovercar and can touch the top of the Big Ben if I jump. Also I can perform complex mathematical operations in milliseconds when a human could take days. So I decided that human won't cut it."</p>
<p>Commander Anderson has been suspended and is being investigated.</p>
<p>Users of the social networking site disagreed or responded in fury to Anderson's tweet.<br />
User Beral tweeted: "Fucking patah I hope u burn in Gre'thor you speciecist cunt".<br />
Another user, Vorin, posted: "Your objectifying a sentient life form is illogical. Have you not learnt anything from your third world war?"<br />
Drone Two of Six, a member of a Borg delegation to Earth wrote: "Non organic life forms can also be assimilated and enrich the collective".<br />
Nausicaan vagabond Ghoshk said "u is insensitive Starfleet"</p>
<p>A Starfleet spokesman commented: "All sentient and intelligent life forms, person-made or not, are treated equally under Federation law. Starfleet is investigating Commander Anderson for his remarks."</p>
<p>"Although we don't want to fuck with twitterers who are calling for his head, we'll only behead him if he is found guilty of speciesism".</p>
