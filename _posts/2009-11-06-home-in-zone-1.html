<p>"Enjoy sitting on that train every day?" the huge sign draped all over the new apartment complex asks us. Said apartment complex is right next to a wide band of railroad tracks.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, the train isn't that bad. It might not work often, but it's spacious and your mobile phone works. In fact I spend a lot more time changing to the (aptly nickamed) Tube and continuing my journey once in zone 1. If there was a poster at the platform advertising a new apartment complex with the tagline "As if working for 'the Man' isn't bad enough, why do you do this to yourself and become a fucking sardine twice a day" that may have affected me enough to hunt high and low for a mortgage.</p>
<p>In fact, it's not our commute those adverts should be focusing on. Commuting to work is only a byproduct of the bigger picture which is that we still have to work. However, I somehow think that "Enjoy hitting numbers on that PC 10 hours a day?" wouldn't be an incitement to buy a flat near the financial district, but rather seems like a question a bookie with balls could ask us.</p>
