<p>I was at Starbucks yesterday doing some reading on the new ASP.NET MVC Framework. Or should I say attempting to do some reading as there were a couple of toddlers screaming well past my earphones, stomping on the floor while running around behind me and sometimes coming too close to me while holding their empty cups formerly filled with kids’ beverages to make me think that they would accidentally launch them towards my laptop’s screen, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.</p>
<p>I wonder if I would be greeted as a hero if I were to approach the oldest of the toddlers and ask him nicely if he knew who Herod the Great was, or perhaps made a suggestion to their mom to buy some weed and roll them a joint to keep them sedated every time they visited a public café. Seriously, parents, your kids are cute to you only.  The rest of use couldn’t give more of a shit if you paid us to.</p>
