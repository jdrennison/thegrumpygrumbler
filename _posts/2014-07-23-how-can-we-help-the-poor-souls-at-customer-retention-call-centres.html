<p>For the lucky of you who don't know, in at least some parts of the Western hemisphere if you want to cancel your insurance/mobile phone/internet you can't just go to their website and do it. You must call a number, navigate through the menu options and thirty minutes later get to the option that includes "...or if you're thinking about leaving us...". There is no waiting time after this, you get through to someone immediately. Then they try to get you to stay with them. If you live in a country where you can cancel your internet or mobile account online or you can call customer service and ask them to cancel your account and they just do it, I'm really jealous.</p>
<p>After hearing <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ryan-block-10/comcastic-service">this phone call</a> between a Comcast former customer and a Comcast retention centre employee, I almost thought "oh, thank Christ I don't live in the U.S. of A" but really it's not different here in Blighty. I was convinced to remain with one of my current telecommunications providers twice when I called them and asked to cancel my subscription when my contract was approaching its end. A few added incentives, advice on how staying with them will help me since my usage is this were cast on me and next thing you know I was signing for a new yearly contract. The other thing they conducted on me was what I call "churn warfare". They just talk and talk and try to negotiate until you think "fuck it, I'll keep the account if that will make him stop".</p>
<p>Those who know me, know that my argument on every topic is "because I fucking want to" or "because I said it is so" but there are circumstances where I actually have to make a case or is preferable to make a case in order not to sound like a <em>complete</em> fuck-shit. One of these cases is this. For all I know the guy I'm speaking to (I guess they don't put women in those retention departments) could be sitting in a 2x2 room in Bangalore having a gun on his head whose holder would fire if the representative failed to keep the customer with the company. Some of them <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/16/5909591/here-s-why-your-comcast-rep-is-yelling-at-you">don't get paid if they fail to keep over 75% of the customers whose calls are directed to them</a>. If I do move to a different provider I'm contributing to the plight of the guy I'm speaking to. The least I can do is get the admittedly good deal he's offering me and with a little extra money on my part he gets to feed his family or pay for a dinner date if he's in the process of starting a family.</p>
<p>So we're in a ridiculous situation where paying for a service we don't need means someone else gets to eat. And although there should not be a correlation between the two, there is, and it affects everyone who is somehow involved with a service provider. Unless you live in a mountain and hunt and gather to eat, you live in the global village and your actions have consequences on you and others no matter how far they are from you.</p>
<p>So, does that mean that you should be held hostage to your cable/fibre/ mobile service provider in order for someone not to resort to begging or stealing to make a living? Of course not. Even if everyone who thought about leaving a service was convinced to remain and you knew about it you are not ultimately responsible for the sales representative's fate. There are plenty of ways to help others ranging from donating to volunteering. You shouldn't feel like a bad person for cancelling an account because if a company does this to its employees it shouldn't have customers anyway.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is that I recently switched providers. I was prepared for a long haul conversation where I'd about lose my shit as soon as the guy started his sales pitch. Instead there was a very nice woman who said something like "sorry you're leaving" a couple of times and half-arsedly attempted to sell me some other packages. They do make half-arsed attempts at selling you things if you suspect that you only pretend you want to live in order to have your bill lowered, which wasn't the case with me. Their manager probably barged into the 2x2 room in Bangalore where they're all packed up and told them that someone shamed Comcast's customer retention and that from now on they have to ease up on UK customers or some of us may start posting recorded calls left right and centre.</p>
<p>If that's true I guess I have Ryan Block to thank for my easy defection.</p>
