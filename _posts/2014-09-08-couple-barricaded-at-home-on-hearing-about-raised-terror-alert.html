<p>A couple has barricaded itself in its house in West London until the terrorist threat the country is facing is 'neutralised'.</p>
<p>Bradley Stone, 45, and Christine Marr, 42, have nailed wooden boards on all of the house's doors and windows and have bought unperishable food to last for three months, according to their estimate.</p>
<p>"The terror alert has been elevated to 'amber', they're not telling us what we're supposed to do about it, so we're just afraid. They're not even telling us what we should be afraid of", Stone told the Bed With Two Wrong Sides Broadcaster on the phone from inside the barricaded property.</p>
<p>"Seriously, they have to give us something", added Christina Marr. "Who knows how many people have gone to fight in Iraq and Syria or how many have returned. All we know is that the government has revved up the threat advisory. So we've done the only sensible thing to do. Now no one is coming in or going out of here."</p>
<p>The barricaded door frames have been sealed with sellotape to prevent gases going into the house "in case of a chemical attack".</p>
<p>The couple has quit their jobs and refuse to pay taxes until the government "does its job properly to protect its citizens".</p>
<p>"After a few days in here, we miss going out but we can't give those murderous savages the satisfaction of getting us", Stone continued. "One of the previous things we attempted was to stare hard at brown bearded looking individuals on public transport to let them know we're watching and make them uncomfortable".</p>
<p>"One of them sneezed on the tube once and I reported him to a member staff for suspicion of bioterrorism".</p>
