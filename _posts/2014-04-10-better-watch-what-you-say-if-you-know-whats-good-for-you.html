<p>As I was re-reading the drafts of my <a title="The one about a guy getting up a strange woman's arse on the tube" href="https://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/why-wouldnt-anyone-help/">previous post</a> I thought I should really be careful what I'm writing. The truth of the matter is I've got writings that haven't seen the light of day either because I'd lose inspiration and leave them incomplete or after reading them I thought "this can easily be misconstrued and my name will be in the papers and my reputation and career in tatters long before any misunderstanding is resolved."</p>
<p>For something to easily be misconstrued it must satisfy the necessary and sufficient condition of being on the fucking internet, if I am to believe the Daily Mail. And why wouldn't I. Just because it's in the Mail doesn't mean it's not true, you  hairy, tree hugging, soap-dodging Guardian reader. Well, it's not true if it says something about me. And this is quite feasible as we'll see right now. Let's take all my posts from last and the current year. It only takes one person to get offended by anything that is on these pages. Then they will think "what an idiot. Anyway what's new on YouTube? "</p>
<p>Or "I can't let this trash freely roam the internet and I have to reply and maybe others will do too". In rare cases they will report you to the police because they feel like sanctimonious little shits.</p>
<p>I was at the pub. One of the guys I was with was talking about an upcoming wedding in India.</p>
<p>"You have to wear one of those ridiculous dresses to go to these weddings".</p>
<p>A few minutes later they were talking about another guy.</p>
<p>"So how come this bloke owns two properties?"</p>
<p>"He's Indian. Indians don't have to work. They do it out of boredom".</p>
<p>People have got into trouble <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/news/world/teacher-fired-over-facebook-pic-1.1023313">for</a> <a href="http://www.heraldonline.com/2008/11/12/950992/charlotte-teachers-face-action.html">less</a> and there these guys were making jokes about Indians. Don't they know that political correctness has gone anal?</p>
<p>Someone once held me personally responsible for the Eurozone being in the shitter, even though I've lived in the UK for decades and haven't looked back. I guess no matter how long you've been living somewhere or how much sophistication you have, you'll just never be one of them. Which is fine as long as I'm treated as an equal.</p>
