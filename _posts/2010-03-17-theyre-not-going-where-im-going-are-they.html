<p>After waiting 10 minutes for the ceiling mounted train table to display a platform number for my train, it finally does and I hear a few exhalation sounds from all around me just three nanoseconds before the stationary crowd becomes a moving mass directed to the platforms.</p>
<p>Yes, face it. All these people will travel on the same train as you. For only one moment you are under the illusion that most of them will be lazy fucks and won't walk all the way to the front coach where you will casually stride in, find three seats in a row waiting for you, but then you realise that you won't be traveling with lazy chavs from Charing Cross Station, but with professionals who also worked overtime like you, and they are willing to walk to the front coach.</p>
<p>As you touch  your Oyster card on the sensor, your todger goes into the behind of the woman in your front for whom the turnstile didn't open. Now I know we all tend to blame a scratched oyster card or a defec tive oyster sensor. But, really, all it takes is to firmly place your oystercard on the reader and WAIT until the doors open.<br />
Whe the train stops at your station, there are two women standing at the door in front of you and they look at each other in puzzlement one of them repeatedly presses the door button and the doors don't budge, until I point out to her that she is pressing the "close" button. Now, I don't know if women really can't read maps as per popular reputation, but I'm more inclined to take that reputation at face value after this.</p>
<p>The bus, however, is a wholly different story. There is no turnstile and if the Oyster of the poor sod in front of you doesn't check out, there's usually a good reason. You can then sneak yours by while they're pontificating whether they should pay by cash or go to the nearest convenience store and top it up. I mean, the bus will be held up for about 10 seconds but at least you will have moved well down and found yourself a nice seat, preferably without chav-marks on it. What those chav-marks may be, I will leave to your imagination.</p>
<p>Just as your bus goes through a stop or two, you hear a recorded female voice saying "This bus is on diversion." Before she can continue with "Please listen to further announcements" most people have got off their seats with discontent clearly seen on their faces. A similar scene in an Athens bus would also be accompanied by  a good proper rant by some male passengers ("fucking whore, wait till I get my hands on you") but none of that happens here. Instead, as I get off my seat I wonder what the TfL's journey planner's good for as very few people seem to use it. Then it comes down to me: I'm not the only lazy fuck on the bus.</p>
<p>I know I've pushed the envelope writing too much about public transport at the expense of other aspects of life but I'll make up for it.</p>
