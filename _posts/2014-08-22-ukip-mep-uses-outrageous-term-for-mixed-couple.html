<p>South East MEP Sally Hadland described the relationship between Sunisa Suriyamongkol, a UKIP-supporting mobile food seller in Ramsgate, Kent, and her husband Bradley Stone in "offensive" terms.</p>
<p>"I mean, look at their age difference. No fucking way she wants him for love and he's defo had her flown in."</p>
<p>Bradley Stone said it was outrageous, rude and offensive and he and his wife would withdraw their UKIP membership. Ms Hadland has issued an apology.</p>
<p>The MEP said: "Jesus Christ, here we go again. I'm sorry that my comments were overheard and brought to the couple's attention."</p>
<p>"It was poor judgement that I had not chosen a more private location to express my views. My constituents weren't supposed to hear that I think British women are too good for this old, fat balding chap or that his wife had found an easy ticket to escape poverty and a military regime."</p>
<p>She was interviewed by the Bed With Two Wrong Sides Broadcaster and had agreed to be filmed while she met local people and UKIP members in Ramsgate.</p>
<p>She wore a microphone and was aware she was being recorded.</p>
<p>Mr Stone and Mrs Suriyamongkol have met Ms Hadland at UKIP rallies.</p>
<p>Mrs Suriyamongkol said: "I'm from Thailand. I'm married to an Englishman whom I love and now I'm British."</p>
<p>"What should I do to prove I love Bradley? Return the jewellery and the Merc I've got from him?"</p>
<p>Mr Stone said Ms Hadland's comments were "unacceptable".</p>
<p>"I'm deeply in love with Sunisa and we're very happy together. I hear her often giggle on the phone and sometimes she says 'not yet, he's still here but he's going on a business trip next week.'. I guess she wants to have fun with her girlfriends and sometimes she may think I'm in the way."</p>
<p>"I totally respect that."</p>
