<h2>Soho and Lan Kwai Fong</h2>
<p>What can one say about these two places. They're magnificent albeit overpriced. I don't say very often that something is "magnificent", I usually do it when I'm on holiday somewhere different and in a good mood.</p>
<p>First of all, you can tell that the quality of the westerners here is so much better than in the West. It makes sense, I guess. If you're prepared to sit in a metal bird for 13 hours to go to an exotic place you're probably learned some hard lessons in life or you've grown up in a sheltered middle-class family with money and you've had a gap year at the back of beyond already and generally have a certain financial reserve to travel the world or be sent abroad on a contract by a big corporation that has hired you over your exemplary communication and problem solving skills. Or some shit. I don't know, it doesn't make sense really. I had heard these are gathering points for westerners and what immediately came to mind was drunkedness, vomiting and glassings. And a strong police presence. Alas, even the drunks could behave themselves there. What has this world come into?</p>
<p>Some bars had "get pissed for less" offers. Also, a bloke would walk around with a tray of syringes with shots in them. I've not seen this in the UK because I suppose there is a law against it. I've never understood this. If there are so many alcohol restrictions in place why not just go all the way and ban it altogether? Or would that be fascist? I understand the bottle is a method of escape for many but they're ruining it for the rest of us who only want to drink a couple of beers and stop there.</p>
<h2>Wan Chai</h2>
<p>Basically, the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">red light district</span> fuck-joints of Hong Kong are congregated here. I knew this before I went there because someone had told me so. There are bars too but many of them act as venues for meetings of a different nature. That I found out by myself. I was minding my own business trying to order a drink from the bar when I felt at least two pairs of Filipino eyes on me. "'Fuck they want" I thought to myself while I was excusing myself towards the beer taps. One of them locks eyes on mine and I smile. She is quite pretty, I wonder if... no, fuck that. This looks too easy, what the fuck is happening here? I grab my drink and turn around to leave then I feel a hand stroking my back. "Hey babe" says the scantily clad woman smiling.</p>
<p>Seriously. I'm all for meeting someone when I'm on holiday but (a) I'm a bit less grumpy when in a holiday mood therefore it would be unfair for her when we're back home and (b) these women are either whores or house cleaners and tourists should watch their backs.</p>
<p>If she's a whore it's quite likely it'll cost you more than you expect. The bar takes commission to allow her to work there. If she doesn't "close", you have wasted her time and yours. In adjacent bars where all the girls are on the clock, one of them comes to chat to you shortly after you walk in and you haven't picked somebody already. If you turn to leave without buying her drinks usually a big guy will block your way out and demand money as the girl has provided you with the service of being a confidante for ten of her minutes. To the people who run these places the business model is quite simple: once you've walked in you're going to part with some of your money whether be it a big or a small chunk in your wallet. I find it rather degrading to pay a girl just to have her talk to me so I've never visited one of those establishments.</p>
<p>If she's a house cleaner she thinks all us whitefolk are loaded. I'm pretty convinced the logic is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tourist has saved up enough to be here and go on a spending spree right now.</li>
<li>The expat was probably sent here on a contract and therefore gets paid the big bucks.</li>
<li>I am working 6 days a week for peanuts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do understand it's not easy for them, breaking their backs 12 hours six days a week and feeding their families back home. Whatever blows their skirts up. I sat on that street drinking for about an hour and a half and the middle-aged white men getting out of that bar with Asian women whom they then put in cabs and then got on them themselves hadn't stopped.</p>
<p>Now, the men who frequent these places. Typically middle aged, many of them fat, a few not fat. Many of them balding, a few, not balding. In fact, I don't understand where the stereotype of the fat, balding middle-aged man who hunts Asian women comes from. Many of those I saw were neither fat not balding. There were all middle aged though. The man of our story is typically in Hong Kong on a 12-month corporate contract with a family back home and could be either of the two types below:</p>
<p><strong>The pissed-off family man.</strong></p>
<p>His wife is bored stiff of him, his teen children hate him. The year in Hong Kong will be an means of escape and to his wife his actions in the SAR are to be treated like a black box. I'm here to put some money on the table and also do you remember that house extension we never had money for? Now we'll be able to have it built. Just don't ask what I'm doing in my free time.</p>
<p><strong>The cheater-by-circumstance</strong></p>
<p>It was a bit harder for him to part with the missus and the kids but it's for the best. Maybe the family can visit in autumn when the weather is not too hot. He wants to discover what Hong Kong has to offer but never thought to do someone other than his wife. Then one evening, an expat coworker or an already existing cheater-by-circumstance he met in Lan Kwai Fong two nights before says to him "want to hit Wan Chai tomorrow? We can get some Asian 'strange' there, man!" He may be madly in love with his wife but he won't see her for a few more months. It only goes to show some things about us. Our girlfriend could be fit as fuck and love us madly but we're just never satisfied and always looking for another hole to shove it through no matter if it's better or worse. Take Hugh Grant for example.</p>
<p>This is what you would expect in Pattaya but surely not in Hong Kong?</p>
