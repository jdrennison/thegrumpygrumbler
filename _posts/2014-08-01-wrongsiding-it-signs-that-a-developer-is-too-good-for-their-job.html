<div style="background:#E5CC7E;padding:20px;">Wrongsiding it is a new series where published articles I have come across, and for the most part agree with, act as a source for commentary. One or two paragraphs from the source posts may be quoted but the whole post will never be copied. A reference and, wherever possible, a trackback will always be given.</div>
<p>It's funny, isn't it, when you read the thoughts of people on the Internet writing things like "if in a job interview, the person interviewing me saying things like XYZ, this is not the place I would want to work anyway". Even in what we keep hearing is a bad job climate there are people who sound like they want to set the terms of employment. The reason why I find this funny is that even after all these years in London I still cast images of the office life in the Old Country where the state of the job market for the job seeker was summed up in "I don't care how much experience you've got, you'll get the minimum wage and if you aren't happy with it there are tons of other unemployed people who will work here for nothing. And don't think you can just look for work elsewhere because they'll tell you what I just have".</p>
<p>There are also no skills on demand there. At all.</p>
<p>So, yeah, it's good that in the better places to live in the world there are trades where the prospective employee sets some of the terms. If any of the below is happening in your case, perhaps it's time to tell your boss you've found two companies that do more interesting stuff than moving buttons and changing colours of page buttons in the same HTML views.</p>
<h3>Your projects bore you</h3>
<p>There are boring times in every job but if you know how to set up a cloud platform, can code front and back end and for the past eight months your work is "add a form to submit some data and have a page where people can pull it to it", then you're too smart for your job.</p>
