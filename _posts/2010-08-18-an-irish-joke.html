<p>I don't know Pat Condell in person but he's exhibited a certain level of stuck-up-cuntness throughout his YouTube career. Yet, I've yet to disagree with anything of what he has ever said in his videos.</p>
<p>His latest one - "An Irish Joke".</p>
<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZmxMlSTETo]</p>
<p>I wonder what he'd have to say about the "<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7918782/We-sell-big-knockers-ad-banned.html">We sell big knockers</a>" advert. If you can't be bothered to click on the link, let me give you the rundown: A door and window company's advert featured a topless woman with the caption "We sell big knockers". A woman got, yes, that's right, offended and the advert was pulled out. Before we even got to see the fucking thing, would you believe.</p>
