<p>I have a job which I love and I live in a decent accommodation. In the UK. Obviously it's not all peachy but no matter how bad life gets, when I hear experiences of friends, family and complete strangers from the Old Country, I thank fuck I left 10 years ago and never looked back.</p>
<p>Let me provide you with some context before I move further on. I come from a place where, if not most people, then a vocal minority believes that when our ancestors gave birth to civilization all westerners swung from tree to tree holding bananas. Also, these days we would have had a far better standing in the world if they had just left us alone and not meddled in our affairs. Also, for most of the history of the nation people lived through centuries of hardship. A table at lunch or dinner time is full of food dishes is a sign of affluence and when a guest comes to visit they are bombarded with food supply every time the host notices that their plate has been emptied. If the guest gets full and stops eating, the host gets offended.</p>
<p style="font-size:.8em;">"But you've hardly eaten anything. Only ten pieces of meat, a mountain of potatoes, four slices of feta cheese and eight meatballs"</p>
<h4>How do you do it? I could hardly think of myself living abroad.</h4>
<p><strong>What they think they are saying:</strong><br />
It's not for everyone leaving friends and family behind and go live somewhere else. I find no reason to adapt to a new life.</p>
<p><strong>What we hear:</strong><br />
You would be foolish to leave this God blessed land to go live among... those alien people.</p>
<p>Again, context:<br />
Unless the educational system has improved over the years (which I doubt) from an early age we are conditioned that we were once the only source of light in the world and every other human achievement can have its roots traced back to us. Therefore, wherever you go you find a bit of our civilization in everything. By not becoming an expat you save yourself the trouble of relocating and also the pains of living in a different culture.</p>
<p>Traditionally very few people in the Old Country have lived abroad just to experience something different and better themselves. Most would do it only under circumstances of hardship, after all other options they could think of have been exhausted. Hell, even holidays abroad seem a bit much although "cool" European capitals have become hip in the last few years. Why wouldn't we just stay where we are with our own sea and sun and food and enough local restauranteurs, travel agents and hoteliers to screw us over.</p>
<h4>Here, have some more. Eat well here before you go back to the UK and eat crap again.</h4>
<p><strong>What they think they're saying:</strong><br />
I'm trying to help as the food there isn't good and has little nutritional value.</p>
<p><strong>What we hear:</strong><br />
Without my cooking you're going to become sick from malnutrition. Of course you could just move back here. Since you evidently can't take care of yourself.</p>
<p>There's no chance you won't find good food in London, for good money. British food contains lots of meat since this is northern Europe we're talking about and a med-diet wouldn't make sense here.</p>
<h4>Don't you miss your family?</h4>
<p><strong>What they think they're saying:</strong><br />
You have been away so long and they miss you. Money and career is good but family is above all else.</p>
<p><strong>What we hear:</strong><br />
No matter how good a life you've got you have effectively abandoned your mum and dad. It doesn't matter that you're 35. You should stay at home until you're married.</p>
<p>I love my parents and they love me. I just don't have to have them in the same town or country all the time for this love to be demonstrated. Also, your parents won't be with you forever.</p>
<h4>A professional with your talents can find good work here. Government ministries announce new job openings all the time.</h4>
<p>Assuming you fulfill said government ministries' near-impossible hiring standards especially for those who have studied abroad (unless you know some official that can get you in through the 'back-channels'), how do you put up with the rest of living there? I've lived through things here and the UK has become my home. People have given this all up to go live in the Old Counrty again out of a feeling of homesickness and vague promises of "well it's not that bad really, you can get some good work and also there's the sun and the sea and us". Everyone I know who's done this is now either unemployed or getting shit money. Some are trying to get through a government ministry's impossible hiring standards. Hard to get in but being under government employ is a surefire way to leave work at the same time every afternoon and while you're in the office, to lean back and take the taxpayer's money.</p>
<h4>If all expats returned and brought Western expertise with them this country would be a better place.</h4>
<p>Far as I know this country will always be a vast hornet's nest of corrupted politicians and citizens and poor infrastructure and a few good people can't change a thing. Many politicians and scientists there have been educated in the West and what good has this brought us? Precisely none.</p>
