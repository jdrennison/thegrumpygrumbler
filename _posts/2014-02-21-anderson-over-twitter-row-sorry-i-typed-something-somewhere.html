<p>A Starfleet officer who yesterday came under fire for referring to a sentient android as "it" on Twitter, has issued a public apology.</p>
<p>Commander (Op-Spec) David Anderson said he should have "thought twice" before posting his tweet.</p>
<p>"I generally censor myself before I tweet something but it seems that people these days get self righteous over the most insignificant shit."</p>
<p>"Will a grovelling apology save me from a dishonourable discharge and my name from being smeared more than it already is? If so, I'm sorry alright? I'm sorry I posted this on the internet."</p>
