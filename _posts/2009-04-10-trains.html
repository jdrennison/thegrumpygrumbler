<p>I felt relieved at the fact I left the office so early in about a year; 6.30 pm. I was at the train station at a few minutes to 7 waiting for the 19:00 train home. It never showed up. The next one was at 19:10 so I waited. After making sure that the electronic announcement board mentioned the station I wanted to get off to, I got in.  It was the wrong train after all.</p>
<p>I got off at the first station the train stopped and which was a few tens of miles from where I wanted to get off. I went to the opposite platform to get on the next train that was going in the same direction I came from and would come in no earlier than 25 minutes.</p>
<p>You know the story; it’s rush hour, everybody is fighting off a few hundreds of other people on the train platforms trying to find a free slot behind the yellow line, there’s noise, commotion and you’ve had 9rough hours at work. You won’t notice anything as petty as the company branding or the interior of the train and how different these two are from the ones on the trains you normally take to and from work. Besides, it’s rush hour and some companies service may be serving some extra routes for all I know.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ended up at the outer boundaries of Zone 6 and my main concern was whether I was going to bump into a conductor on my way back as I wasn’t going to paya single extra penny for a mistake I’m solely putting the blame on them? At this instance it’s the company that manages the station from which I take the train home. Well, come to think about it I might as well lay the blame to all the other passengers that get in my way by having the preposterous idea of returning to their homes at the same time as I. What wouldn’t I give to find a desolate platform on which I can walk around freely while waiting for a non-delayed train to come and take me.</p>
