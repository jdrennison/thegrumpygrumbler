<p>I recently became the proud owner of a Nokia E71. That's the good news if I assume, for the sake of the conversation, that they haven't taken me for a ride with the new talking plan that I bought. </p>
<p>I already know that as soon as many people see it, they will ask me the Question. No, no that one. The other one. </p>
<p>"Why on Earth didn't you get an iPhone?"</p>
<p> When I was looking for which handset I should buy, I spend a considerable amount of thinking about it. Basically I wanted to choose between the Nokia and the Sony Ericsson C510. The iPhone, never crossed my mind.</p>
<p> Yes, I know that the iPhone is cool, alright? But so are BlackBerries and the E71. There's method in the perceived madness of those of us who write off the iPhone.</p>
<p> 1. It's expensive as fucking hell for a phone. Think about it. The cheapest line rental at O2 with iPhone 3GS(8GB)  and the “simpler” 3G (8GB) is £34.26 a month. Play.com does the 3GS – 8GB for £500. Why pay such money for a handheld that gives you not much more than the next smartphone on the market, nothing that you cannot get on your smartphone off the air without much effort, that is, save the compass, the proximity and the orientation sensors, but these and other small gimmicks aren’t worth the £34.26/month / £500 for the handset. I know there are equally expensive Nokia smartphones in that case you can always go for a cheaper option such as the E71 for £270, if you're buying the handset only.</p>
<p> 2. Battery is not removable. Not acceptable, and it will show if you make full use of your mobile and its software. Using the WLAN or the odd media player is a great way to drain the battery and if you have an iPhone only a nearby socket can save you.</p>
<p> You can buy an original Nokia battery on Nokia website for your E71 for around £20. It’s a saver if you’re on the move and absolutely need your phone when you’re on the move.</p>
<p> 3. Nokia E series has taken after the BlackBerry and employs a physical QWERTY keyboard. When you want to type in a large document, a virtual keyboard like that of the iPhone's won't let you feel when a button is pressed, so you have to continually look up and down between your text and the virtual keyboard. I'm sure that if future versions of the iPhone don't feature a physical keyboard, they will come out with haptic technology which won't be as good as using the real deal (haptics is the technology that interfaces with the user through the sense of touch). I've written this post with my E71 in a series of oveground trips as well as the tube and while I was totally inept when I first started writing this test on its keyboard, i'm now getting better and better.</p>
<p> 4. Bluetooth. iPhone only connects to a wireless headset, a PC or Mac or possibly another iPhone. Not to other non-iPhone handsets.</p>
<p> And these are the reasons why I wouldn't buy an iPhone.</p>
<p> As I was looking at the brochures of the various phone offers I was quite appalled by the various so-called "features" on prominent places in them. Facebook. Youtube.  Bebo. I don't know which is worse; that one out of many criterions for many young people as to which handset to pick is how quickly they can update their status and let the world know that they had a "fab" time last night or the fact that phone makers and vendors actually deem these features important enough to take up a large space on an advert poster. Frankly, you can get to Facebook and whatfucking ever else from any phone that has a browser.</p>
<p> After 5 years in London I think of myself as someone who has pretty much sussed out his mobile phone needs and rougly which calling plans will be the best money saver. Then I'm always surprised by how they manage to keep their calling plans complicated at all times. We live in the free West. Here, the idea is that we have a choice of things by contrast with North Korea or the Middle East or the old Soviet regime. But don't you feel that you were kind of lead on many times when buying something? They lower down the price of something they want to sell most of and then they cap the offer's length. Now, the average worker's salary in London is £27000. Put all of your monthly expenses together, you just want to save money from wherever you can, so you're for going their "offer". That also applies to groceries and pretty much everything else but this entry is only concerned with mobile phones and call plans because this is where it shows the most.</p>
<p>It's just that fucking feeling, that deep down you're had all the time.</p>
