<p>Did you know that 11 hour work days are bad for your heart? I've just found out. Someone was reading a free paper on the train and the page he was on had that article. Curious, I searched it on google. The article is pretty much the same in all of the search results. 6000 British workers were "studied" and although there was no definitive proof that working long hours cause coronary heart disease, there is a "clear link". That's a bit like saying although there is no direct proof that going to the local news agent at 10am will cause you to get stabbed by a robber, there is a clear link between going to buy beer late at night and get stabbed. Although they do admit that if you get a heart attack it "may" be related to the pressure you get from work, the same pressure you feel when you feel compelled to work 11 hours a day.</p>
<p>So here's something that we didn't know thus far. Being stressed at work can be bad for your heart. It can also be bad for your personal life and your marriage but for some reason these two don't seem matter much for the papers whenever they feature an article about overtime.</p>
<p>On an average week I work 60 - 65 hours and I get paid for 40. I don't like it but I doubt it's any different in most software companies unless you work in GooglePlex where, as we keep being told, it's fucking awesome. The point I'm trying to make is that before that heart problem that you may or may not develop sometime in your career, you will lose other things, earlier.</p>
<p>Well I suppose if we bring this to our boss's attention that'll fix things, eh.</p>
