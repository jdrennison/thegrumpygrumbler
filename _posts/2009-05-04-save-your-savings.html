<p>The interest rate on my savings account had fallen on ridiculously low levels, so I went to my bank to ask for an explanation.</p>
<p>The exotic-looking fellow who offered me a seat at his desk said to me that “yes, indeed, sir, the interest rates have gone quite low in the past few months”. Oh, yes, the crisis.  Which, by the way, doesn’t explain why credit card interest rates haven’t also gone quite low. Nevertheless the exotic looking chap tried to sell me one, which I thought was a good idea to get as some web sites do not accept debit cards as payment. This is how they get you. You go to speak to your bank about an entirely different matter and they spin the conversation to credit cards.</p>
<p>I resisted the temptation to ask him how come credit card interest rates are still so extortionate  whilst I will have to look for a different savings option, if I want to make some money out of my existing money. The bloke booked me up for an appointment with an investment adviser for the next day and I went home to sleep on it.</p>
<p>Next day mid-day, I was in the same branch again, being seen by a middle aged man who was speaking the “Queen’s English” but had a last name that I think was Armenian. The Indian from the day before asked if he can observe, presumably because he was an investment adviser in the making and wanted to get another glimpse of how it’s done. The middle aged man presented me with a line graph with various figures about how equities, government bonds, cash and another couple of investments have done in the last 15-20 years.</p>
<p>Now if you’re like me (similar age, similar life experience and job field other than finance/banking/money related) then you probably don’t know jack shit about any of this.  I gave all those terms a whirl at Wikipedia and just to confirm that it’s not that I can’t understand anything because English isn’t my first language, I then tried it in Greek and to my horror I realised I had the same difficulty. You want to trick me into handing you my money so I don’t see it again, you’ve found the right person.</p>
<p>I resigned from my effort to understand what the man was narrating to me and in him I began to see a sleazy bastard who was clearly on a mission to rob me of the money that I worked hard to put away since I arrived to the country.</p>
<p>“Can I stop you there”, I said, “I’m only after a savings account to put my money away to since the interest rates on the one I’ve got are pretty much as low as my current account’s these days.”</p>
<p>“Oh I thought you said to me yesterday that you wanted to discuss a 3-5 year plan for your saved money”, his younger colleague said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, I slept on it and I think I’m better off locking it away for the short term”, I said.</p>
<p>I understand that we are in the midst of a crisis and bank clerks are workers too, trying to to their job. They deserve our sympathy and not our scold, which is why I didn’t shoot them down.</p>
