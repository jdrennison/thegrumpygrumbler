<p>Is it a coincidence that every time someone goes out on a shooting rampage everyone afterwards say "I can't believe that a person like him would do such a thing. He was always kind to everyone."</p>
<p>When will someone say "The bloody bastard was a murderer waiting to happen. Deep down he was a twat. I didn't believe he was actually going to do it but there it happened."</p>
