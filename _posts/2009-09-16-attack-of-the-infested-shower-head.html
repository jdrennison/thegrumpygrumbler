<p>I haven't yet found the nerve to tell my mates in Greece to fuck off next time they send me a chain mail of what is perceived as a joke. At the moment I am just content with just deleting the gits without looking inside. Yesterday, however, I received an e-mail with a URL starting with 'http://news.bbc...' on the subject line.</p>
<p>It must be important, I thought. Perhaps Anthony is watching what's going on in this country as the "politicians" are wrecking it and he wanted to bring my attention to something I may have already seen but sometimes you just don't know.</p>
<p>"Taking showers can make you ill", the title read, and the article body went on explaining that your shower head contains "dangerous bacteria" and they make their way to your skin when you take a shower.</p>
<p>That's right. The Bacterial Shower Head is coming to sit next to the Bacterial Keyboard in the Bacterial Hall Of Fame. You remember that one? Yes, it's the keyboard that is n times dirtier than a public unflushed shitter (where n &gt; 2). What was your reaction when you first heard that? Very few people would, I presume, rush off to shed alcohol on their keyboard. Most likely, the reaction of the rest would have been "Fuck them scaremongers".</p>
<p>There is no denying that keyboards accumulate germs, but so does a mobile phone's keypad, a train/bus support railing, a steering wheel, money, keys, especially if you drop them on the ground or the floor. Everybody can deduct that simple truth. And what do we do about it. Jack shit, of course. Me, I can't be arsed. And in any case none of the people I know will ever take off their shower head and immerse it in bleach dissolved in water on a monthly basis.</p>
