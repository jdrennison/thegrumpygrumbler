<p>"When was the last time you saw Mr. David Anderson?" asked the Met detective.<br />
"Well, he came to the office two days ago, went on his lunch break and never came back." said the director.<br />
"His wife called the office the next day and when we told her he's not come back since last afternoon she said she would call the police"<br />
"I see. What is the position held by Mr. Anderson in your company?"<br />
"He is an IT project manager. He manages the timescales and the delivery of our technology projects".<br />
"That's all I needed to ask. If anything turns up will you call me on this number please."<br />
"Of course. Oh there's something else which I don't know if it matters much but I think I should tell you anyway. The last thing he said before he disappeared was to one of the guys in the development team. I overheard him because I happened to be walking by at the time."<br />
"He said. 'It can't be a big job can it? We are already doing this in another part of the codebase'."</p>
