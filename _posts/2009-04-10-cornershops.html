<p>You’ve got to love those third worlders(*) that staff the cash till in cornershops. If you’re a bloke you’ve no doubt been called “boss” at least once by one of them if they’re a bloke also.</p>
<p>Well, if I were their boss they would  be given the bloody sack on the spot.</p>
<p>(*) It’s ok to call a restaurant waiter an “exam failure” behind their back, but calling a cornershop clerk a “third worlder” is not ok? Quite a few waiters don’t do this job by virtue of having failed an exam, but can you claim that the vast majority of convenience store clerks in London are not third worlders?</p>
