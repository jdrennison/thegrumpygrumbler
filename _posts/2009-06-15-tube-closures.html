<p>It beggars fucking belief. For many weeks the Jubilee line has been closed on weekends.</p>
<p>Jubilee Line is one of the most modern-looking tube lines which connects together a great deal of south east London. I don't know how they are "transforming our tube" and it probably will be a seemless operation to us anyway. After they're done with the transformations we will continue taking the tube as before and still be crammed in like sardines during the rush hour.</p>
<p>I wonder if someone high up in the TFL chain of command wakes up on a Monday morning and thinks "right, whose weekend shall I fuck up this week? Ah yeah, these fuckers living in Rotherhithe, Canada Water, West Hampstead, St John's Wood and Swiss Cottage have had it easy until now, how about I go about having Jubilee Line closed every weekend for the next six months?"</p>
<p>We wouldn't have had any of this if it weren't for the Olympics and a handful of wealthy foreigners who will use the Tube for two weeks and will then leave never to be seen or heard from again. Who gives a shit for the residents of this town who will remain here after the Olympics have finished? If we are benefited at all by this "transformation" it will be nothing but a side effect.</p>
