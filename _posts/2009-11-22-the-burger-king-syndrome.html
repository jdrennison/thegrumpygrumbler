<p>Burger King Syndrome. Short for "There is a specific time of a specific day each week when every twat on Charing Cross Station decides to snap into hunger-mode at once. That day and time is Saturday 11pm."</p>
<p>Go home on an empty stomach or wait on a 15m queue that isn't moving fast and miss your train. You decide.</p>
