<p>I spent two hours waiting for my train home. For the past two weeks I've been working 15 hours a day includingast weekend so when I finally managed to escape my office early for once (8.30pm) I thought I could at last put my feet up for an hour and enjoy two cups of tea.</p>
<p>And it would indeed have turned out like that if some nob wasn't hit by a train on the line that my train uses.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about the details but I would think it isn't pretty when you get hit by a train so there's probably a lot of mess to clean up. And although passing trains wouldn't have much of a problem to pass through splattered brains i'm imagining this is not the case with scattered bones as those might derail a train and that's why they were "delayed". It's also an accident scene so there must be an ongoing investigation over there. Not that they've labelled it an accident. On the train website it just says that "a person was hit by a train" as if they're describing a bar fight scene.</p>
<p>I guess if it was a suicide they would have said that a "fatality" occurred or something similar. If someone fell into the gap between the train and the platform they would have used the word "injured". I guess, that is. I mean how easy is it to fall into the rail tracks with a thick yellow line that's half a meter away from the gap rim?</p>
<p>So let's assume it's a suicide. In that case I'd like to send a message out to all prospective suicide commiters. Please, pretty please with sugar on top, do kill yourselves during early office hours when there'll be plenty of time to clean up your spilled guts off the tracks before people start to leave their offices. You may have lost your jobs and can't pay your debts but throwing yourselves on the tracks when a train is passing by isn't working well for the rest of us who still have jobs and work 14 hours a day to keep them, now is it? We get home even later, we sleep even less and we are at risk of making mistakes the next day when we go to work tired. If you've read this and still want to commit suicide at/after home-time, then you're a hater and I hope you die. Err... Scrap that. I hope you'll burn in hell if there is afterlife. Which I think there isn't. But that's a topic for another entry.</p>
