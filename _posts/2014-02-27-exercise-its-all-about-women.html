<p>Personal trainer: so why do you want to exercise?<br />
Me: To look good for women.<br />
PT: Any other reasons?<br />
Me: Absolutely none. It's all about the chicks.</p>
<p>And I'm doing this just in case I up my odds with them a little bit. It's not hard to improve from zero you think? Well, it damn well is for me.</p>
<p>Any other reason to exercise, keep healthy for example, is but a by-product. Keeping healthy = living longer if you don't get terminally ill or have an accident. Just think though: you'll be working until you're 65. The average lifespan of a man is 74 years. That means you'll have busted your arse all your life so you can get a shit pension for the last nine years of your life unless you're on a private annuity program.</p>
<p><a href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2014/02/19/annuity-provider-comparison/" title="Annuity providerÂ comparison">Oh there is that too.</a></p>
<p>Other joyful things that you could come your way during your short stay in this life: muggings, being made redundant at 45, cancer and let's not forget that after the trade centres were hit we have woken up to the reality of terrorism and for five years we have been living in an economic hell that probably won't end in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>Why would you want to do this alone?</p>
<p>I'm at an age where shit starts to break down in your body if you don't take care of it. Do I want to exercise to postpone the inevitable failure of various body parts? Only if I'm to spend most of the rest of my life with a companion.</p>
