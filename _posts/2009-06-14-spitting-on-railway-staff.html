<p>Those "don't assault our staff" adverts are everywhere. For good reason indeed as there are plenty of <a title="We've talked about this before" href="http://thegrumbler.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/human-wastelands/" target="_blank">subhuman cunts</a> who can't seem to know how to behave themselves. Today I saw another one on the DLR:</p>
<blockquote><p>I spat on a member of staff and thought nothing of it. A few months later, I was arrested.</p>
<p><em>Abuse, Assault, Arrest: Our staff are here to help you. Spitting on DLR staff is classified as an assault and is a criminal offence. Saliva Recovery Kits are now held on every train and will be used to identifty offenders against the national DNA database.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Let's get real here: The staff is not here to help us, they're here to put food on their table and maybe give some directions, although to take the DLR from A to B should be, as Americans would say, "a no brainer". But in any case they do have the right to work without the fear of threats or violence.</p>
<p>But the bottom line of this entry is that I can't for the life of me understand who in their right mind would spit on another human being who at the end of the day are just working their shift and want to get home to their families. Why would someone spoil another person's day like that? Especially in the DLR where interaction with staff is minimal. But apparently there are enough such incidents so that they put up those posters on DLR coaches.</p>
<p>What's next, chavs taking a shit on their palm and throwing it at rail staff?</p>
