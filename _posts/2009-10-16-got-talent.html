<p>It has come to my attention that a cousin of mine has appeared on Greece's Got Talent and there's a relevant clip on YouTube to attest to that.</p>
<p>They say you should be able to choose your friends but not your relatives. To protect his privacy, no, scrap that, to protect MY privacy rather, I won't publish a link to the YouTube video. I can see his point though; he's a productive age yet lives on the dole and has too much free time to piss about and obviously he got paid to appear on the episode he did. When I was shown the vid with his act, I just knew; I can think up a hundred ways to waste my time but to see a clip of my cousin on Greece's got Talent will actually make me want to invent time travel and reclaim 2 minutes of my life.</p>
<p>The "judges" there are cut from the same cloth as Simon Cowell et al. Talentless yet lucky enough to ascend to showbiz, on the brains department they're no different than the general population and obviously they took a couple of risks in order to get money and fame which turned out to their advantage. Their replacement is standing on the stage before them, longing for their approval.</p>
<p>I won't go on on how talents got discovered before the talent show era. That goes without saying. What I don't understand is why one would make a complete motherfucking cunt out of oneself to prove a point or, for that matter to pass one's time. It's one thing to be judged by examiners on how well you have studied a profession, in which case you can appreciate their judgement and perhaps take no for an answer. On top of that, the examiners will not take the piss on you like Simon Cowell does.</p>
<p>"Quit fucking watching it then", I hear you say. Fair enough. Might I mention that I haven't, in fact, seen one single episode of any of that. That doesn't mean you've just escaped it, no. A member of your family or a friend or an acquintance will be obsessed with it and talk about it. I've had two guys in their mid-30s telling me how gracious Susan Boyle was and that how everybody who judged her by her looks should be ashamed of themselves and oh I was one of those too and I'm so full of regrets now. In short, a type of conversation one would expect only from our girlfriends when they were away from us in a shopping mall while we were focused on the important business at hand, i.e. getting pissed up at the pub at 2pm.</p>
<p>In the recent years we men have been politically corrected like nobody's business. In a sane world, Billy Elliot would have gone to his dad begging him to register him for boxing classes. Britain's Got Talent would be aired on a 4th class cable channel. There would be a variant of Sex And The City with men. See where I'm going with this?</p>
