<p>I've never been to Washington, D.C. Modern Warfare 2 was the tip on the iceberg in a series of many stimulis that are making me want to go and visit.</p>
<p>By that I mean that I had once placed my visit to Washington in a vague date between 2007 and 2015 but now I'm reconsidering thinking that if I'm to go and see it I'd better be quick because it's in for big trouble.</p>
<p>In Modern Warfare 2 it's invaded by Russian ground forces. Most of its landmarks are decimated.</p>
<p>In H.A.W.X. it's invaded by a private military contractor's fleet of fighter and bomber jets.</p>
<p>In Fallout 3 it's been destroyed by a nuclear attack. I know at least that ICBMs tend to do a lot of damage but most of DC's landmarks are still standing. I suppose how else would the gamer know which city they're in?</p>
<p>In World in Conflict, it's leveled by a nuke. Properly leveled this time. Landmarks inclusive.</p>
<p>In Dead Zone, Johnny Smith sees an apocalyptic version of the future where a nuclear bomb falls on Washington in retaliation for the Americans' launch.</p>
<p>In Seven Days, a disgruntled former serviceman nukes DC.</p>
<p>In Transfer of Power and Season 7 of 24, the White House is taken over by terrorists.</p>
<p>And recently, in The Pursuit of Honour, DC is rocked by multiple terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Of course, Fallout 3 isn't remotely plausible. The idea of a future devastated America occupied by mutant humanoids makes for a good fiction story nobody believes it will ever happen except for guys who live in their mum's basement. Global war and terrorist scenarios, though, are another story. Of course, London is also attacked in fiction, but mostly by aliens or deadly plagues, both scenarios far fetched.</p>
<p>So what's with Washington?</p>
