<p>I've been tied up with various shit lately. You know you've been away from blogging for too long when they've changed the home page so much that you think you've mistyped the URL. I've been meaning to write something about office Christmas parties for about a week now, since we've had ours, but due to the verbosely described reasons above, I postponed it until today.</p>
<p>I googled the following terms the other day:<br />
"office christmas party" "do I have to go"<br />
"office christmas party" "don't want to go"<br />
"avoid the office christmas party"</p>
<p>I suppose I was trying to locate a genuine, heart-to-heart anonymous rant by someone who is due for his annual office Christmas party but would prefer to jump off a cliff instead. I did found one on the first page and even that didn't expand much on the subject but it grasped the meaning of not going to the party. The other search results in pages 1 and 2 strongly instruct you to go. I didn't bother with page three and beyond since I thought that if it's not on the first two pages, obviously someone's ranting about their upcoming office Christmas party wasn't deemed important by most google visitors, hence... I don't know. I'm sure it isn't the case that everyone is looking forward to that. Who is longing to see their collegues in various stages of sobriety by the end of the evening, raise glass with the man who had been berating them in front of a client only 4 days ago in order to make an impression to said client and generally spend as many as many as 7 hours that could be spent in valuable, personal time, with the people they see at least 40 hours a week, 48 weeks a year?</p>
<p>Most of these websites assume that you can turn up anytime you want "but not as soon as the party starts",  and that you can leave anytime you want "but stay at least two hours". None mentions what you could do differently in the case that a cab fleet has been called to pick up all the staff immediately after work, and another will do the same at the end of the evening (which is 1:30am) and everyone is expected to turn up for work at 9am the next day?</p>
<p>There's not much you can do there. As much as I hate office Christmas parties or any other work function that involves anything more than a swiftie at the local boozer, I believe that if you don't understand why you must go then you should submit your resignation on the spot. What you do there is your prerogative. Me, I normally glom on the people with whom I'm kind of familiar and that's it. You can text or phone people who aren't there all night long if you like. But go you must.</p>
<p>At some point I was texting a friend who wasn't there and telling her about my plight. She replied with "I don't go to office christmas parties cos I can't be bothered. I don't care what my colleagues think of me. I have bigger worries. If you don't want to come you don't have to provide a reason to your boss. It's none of their business. Sod them all and go home."</p>
<p>Fair enough. Don't you think? Why didn't I think of that myself? This would work out perfectly. Apart from the fact that even if attending office parties isn't part of your contracted duties, you still should go because it's part of your unofficial duties.  Yes, there are those too. Why are they not on your contract? Do you think you would take seriously your employment if your contract read something in the lines of:</p>
<p>1. To design and develop software applications<br />
2. To design and develop the back end database(s) to support the applications<br />
3. To thoroughly test and debug software applications designed and developed by the Company<br />
4. To maintain in-house software applications throughout their life cycle.<br />
5. To attend the Company's annual Christmas function where every employee is required to remain in the venue until 1:30am and resume duties in precisely 7.30 hours after the end of the function.</p>
<p>Perhaps clause 5 is not there because when I signed up we did Christmas lunches at the time. Yet, not even that is in my contract.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. However, you can do all those other things we mentioned. Even if you should go to the office Christmas party, there's no obligation on your part to talk to anyone and be animated and friendly. Do your thing and let them wonder why you don't mingle.</p>
<p>I'm a very miserable bastard at work, bordering on subhuman, some would say. At the office party, I was beastly even after a few Budweisers, which isn't like me. This has no correlation with the tone of my writings here. I'm definitely not grumpy - except for the times that I am - and I don't only find ills with the world - although I do find a huge lot of them. It's just that I and many others like me can't help but spot the ludicrous in situations that those non-afflicted regard as normal. We take amusement or irritation in things that seem to slip everyone else by. For example, when they tell us that with your "triple play" communications package you get a free digital tv decoder, but the "one-off set up fee" is Â£60 and their competitor does not have a set up fee but the monthly cost is a little bit higher. You see a pack of lamb loins with a big yellow sign that says "Buy one get one free" and you think that just one pack is already overpriced. You read on the paper "pregnant teen dies of swine flu" and wonder if anyone else reading this thought "two fewer chavs on benefit".</p>
<p>It is in that sense that my bed has two wrong sides. Of course, being that and a miserable bastard are not two mutually exclusive things.</p>
<p>In fact I tried, yes, I tried to have a little fun as well. Like try and hit on the boss's lovely secr... err... office manager. Just a bit of harmless flirting with no expected outcome. She is, after all, a co worker. Ok, maybe I pushed it a little too far, knowing that I won't be trying something like that with her until the next Christmas Party, if I go and if I'm still working in the same company, but I wasn't inclined to do anything serious, and she was even less so.</p>
<p>A few metres away there was a 50+ drunk bird who was rubbing some younger bloke's todger over his trousers. Just what one needs on a weeknight. But it was nice to see that she's still got it in her.</p>
<p>Next year, the company should pay us to go out to different parties seperately, on Friday night. Yeah, that's the ticket.</p>
