<p>Forty isn't a good age to be. To prove the point, find me just one person who has said once in their lifetime "God, I wish I could accelerate time and turn forty right now. The wait is killing me, pretty please, I want to be forty!"</p>
<p>Granted we didn't do that when we were approaching 30 but it was a lot more bearable in that you were a full-grown adult, had had about a decade of independence from home and you were one more decade away from being middle-aged. For women, they have ten more years to bear children.</p>
<p>When you finally do turn 40 you realise that rather than suddenly becoming 40, you've been becoming 40 since you realised that certain things have been happening.</p>
<p>Women that look roughly ten years younger than you want children.<br />
Men your age have gone through a divorce.<br />
Friends disappear because they have two toddlers to begin with.</p>
