<p>If you are an adult your short sightedness is not likely to increase within the course of two years. Yet the opticians won't sell you new contact lenses unless you have a "valid" prescription, that is pay £20 every year to have your eyes checked and be issued a new contact lens prescription.</p>
<p>The idea is that within the course of one year, your health may change or you may be taking medication you hadn't taken the year before and that could have an impact on your comfortability with the foreign objects that are the contact lenses. That's a valid argument but I'd like to learn of one single case where one's health circumstances have changed so that one got irritated or even went blind after a year had elapsed and did not consult an optician. Besides why does a prescription have to be renewed on yearly intervals since the odds are perfectly legitimate that one may develop a problem 3 months after a consultation?</p>
<p>Then they said they can sell me a pack of three pairs because my prescription is expiring next month. Because they don't sell packs of one pair, which makes it ok to break the law and sell me products that will expire at the end of November, I suppose. </p>
<p>What they don't get is that this is London and there are many Italians, Greeks, Spaniards, all within 3.5 hours away from somewhere we go twice a year to stock up on packs of contact lenses among other things.</p>
