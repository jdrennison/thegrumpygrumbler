<p>What did I learn from going to the Clapham Common fireworks display and missing it? </p>
<p> Up until a few years ago, every single time I took the metro or overground train and my mum was with me, as soon as we got on the train she would always point to a couple of empty seats at the back and go "look there's one over there, hurry, sit down!". I'd never do that. I don't know why, but I was always very relaxed about it. Perhaps I thought standing would be a good exercise or was even feeling sorry for those elderly people who were mixing with daytime workers on the coach. Although, just like pregnant women and buggy pushers they shouldn't be really mixing with the productives during rush hour, I would think "eff it, they're here now so". My mum would wait until I went for the seat and when I said "no mum, you sit, I'm fine standing" she would make a face when someone else would ultimately go sit on the once empty seat. </p>
<p> Things are different now. Senior citizens in London know better than taking the train at rush hour. The same can be said of pregnant women for the most part, but not of proud mothers with buggies. And my compassion has diminished ever since I was introduced to the daily grind. You want me to move down the train? Tough shit, get the next one which, by the way is running as close as 30 seconds to this one, so there is no reason to hold up this one for a good 3 minutes just because everybody has to get in. Don ask us in that patronising/mistress tone to move down the train. You know what, people don't mone down the train. They make faces and ignore you. We all hope that you'll give up and wait for the next train which, if I haven't mentioned it already, is 30 seconds behind this one and is waiting for our one to leave so it can enter the station. What part of "this train is now ready to depart" are you having trouble understanding? Good people have missed a good fireworks display cos of some bitches who weren't waiting their turn. </p>
<p> That's how come I stopped caring. Everyone of them is just a number. I will push to get on the train. I will not show signs of chivalry when I see an empty seat. Here it's every man for himself. </p>
<p> When British Rail and the Tube were first introduced they must have been such pioneering achievements. Multiple levels above or below ground, with signs that even someone with the brain of an amoeba can't get wrong. No amount of improvement, however, can cope woth the ever increasing London population. </p>
