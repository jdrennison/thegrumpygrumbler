<p>Since when do we feel guilty for taking holiday? Since when? Isn't it our union-given right to have holidays and forget about work? Yet any holiday that is more than two days makes you feel you're not attending to somebody's money making desire. Someone is not making money while you're on a beach, so don't go on the beach.</p>
<p>When you do manage to go away for a while assuming that your colleagues will take care of your affairs anyway they can, you dread that phone call from the office administrator. "Uh yeah, sorry to bother you on your holiday, but Sue is having a problem with 3000 end users who aren't receiving the e-mails with the code to activate their user accounts. Can you find a wi-fi connection in the hotel you're in and fix it ay-sap please?" Which would be, I suppose, fine if the company were mine. But it isn't, hence the lack of motivation. Assuming my company can launch several products on time and rake it in, I won't be receiving another penny, save the expected and well deserved yearly pay-rise. So where is the motive? Yet, off the top of my head I have two counter-motives. One, I have two people that will bollock me if I make a mistake. So counter-motive one is that I don't want to be hassled. Counter-motive number two is the fear of losing my job. But as we all know that will only make one work just hard enough not to get fired. And will get just enough of a pay rise not to quit.</p>
<p>Anyway this was going to be an entry about this weekend. Thursday was the day of departure. At the train station, I asked for a latte with one brown sugar and as the barista was making it, I realised I had had no cash. That wasn't really the problem as everyone accepts cards at this time and age. The lack of display of a card machine kind of troubled me, though, so I asked the barista if they accepted cards and she said no.</p>
<p>"Right… I haven't got cash, you see", I said to her.</p>
<p>"Is that so? I've just made your coffee, so what am I going to do with it now?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about that. I assumed that you have a card machine since pretty much every other coffee shop in the world does these days."  Except in Greece and probably in the third world shitter you're coming from, is what I omitted to tell her.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, we don't. Ok, fine, don't worry about it."</p>
<p>"I'm not worried. I haven't paid for the drink so it's not my problem."</p>
<p>That was mean but I pretty much get like that at 6:30am.</p>
<p>I arrived at Gatwick and went to the check-in desk. You've read this here before; those questions they ask you when you hand in your luggage, yet it never gets old. There is a loud voice inside me urging me to make a joke. I just have to do it some day. "Yes, a bearded Asiatic man gave me a metallic canister with a green LED on. He was also watching my luggage when I went to get a latte from the nearby Costa. He mentioned to me something about fireworks in the sky but I'm assuming there's a festival here somewhere which he's going to attend." The other one I fancy is "My aunt gave me a birthday present for my cousin who lives in London. I haven't seen the inside of it but my aunt is a devout Christian so there's nothing to worry about now, is it". Then I envision the continuation: sixteen men with bulletproof vests and wielded sub machine guns closing in on me, so I leave it.</p>
<p>There were queues in every shop, even in the toilets. I think it was the first time in my life I had to queue to take a shit. As if this were not all, there were no coat hangers in the toilets either so I had to leave my rucksack on the floor. Don't worry though, the toilet room was reasonably big so I left it next to the door.</p>
<p>I'm still tempted to turn on my mobile phone in flight or use my MP3 player during take off and landing. A advanced aircraft with a state-of-the art nav system couldn't possibly be interfered with when you listen to H.E.A.T.'s new CD, eh? No… but who will make the first step and prove this is so?</p>
<p>Upon my return to Gatwick, the pilot said that we mustn't use any electronic devices until the aircrafe comes to a halt and the doors are open, or they would interfere with the aircraft's system. Yeah. The pilot will crash the aircraft into the jet bridge if you're impatient to check your texts.</p>
<p>Thing is, there is no scientific proof that "electronic devices" "interfere" with an aircraft's systems. It's all about reminding us who the fuck wears the pants in the relationship lest some of us forget.</p>
