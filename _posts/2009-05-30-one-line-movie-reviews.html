<p>I saw a Star Trek poster in the tube today. For now, I'll let slide the out-of-time-place-and-franchise figure of James T. Kirk a-lá James Dean on a bike in the center of the poster and I'll focus on the one-line reviews that appear near the fringe of the image.</p>
<p>All movie posters have one-line comments on them that go by "Brilliant", "Exceptional", "If you get to see only one movie this year make it this one", you get the drift. I don't remember seeing so many comments on any poster other than Star Trek's. Alright, so a bunch of people who get paid to see movies are telling us which ones they like, using large letters. In case we don't get the message the first time, there's not one or two one-line comments but about 15 of them, just for good measure. Who knows, maybe they'll get to turn a few people around and go see the movie. Oh, will they bog roll.</p>
<p>I wonder what it would be like once to see a poster with the usual praising one-liners and a few others thrown in along the lines of "Don't even bother mate". I suppose there's no place for "movie critics" to swim among the sea of praising comments and try to warn us not to throw money away on something they watched and found repugnant.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think Zachary Quinto did so good a job that I couldn't think of him for a second as Sylar with pointy ears.</p>
