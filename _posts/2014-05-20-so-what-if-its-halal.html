<p>Every couple of years tabloids in the UK protest vehemently about halal meat being in grocery stores' shelves without the consumer knowing about it. The last incarnation of this happened a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>The idea behind selling only halal meat is saving money as both Muslims and non-Muslims can eat halal. I suppose Jews too can eat halal. Which is probably why we've never heard any professional worry-inducers informing us about kosher meat being sold without us knowing about it.</p>
<p>I'd like to know if my meat is halal or kosher just out of curiosity. But what's the fuss about? It's still the same meat and the only difference is how the animal it comes from is killed. Sure there's some worry about animal cruelty because in halal and kosher butchering the animal dies slowly. Well, shit. Look how this cow is peacefully eating grass without a care in the world. Little does she know that parts of her will be on my plate soon with plenty of gravy and a Yorkshire pudding. Just make sure she's got a swift and painless death 'fore I gobble up her arsecheeks because what's more important than proteins and vitamins I need is that my eventual dinner isn't in pain when its life is extracted.</p>
<p>Our concern for cattle will never extend to not eating them so does it matter how they expire? This "humane killing" of animals thing, has only become a thing in the recent years possibly because it sounded like an oxymoron in previous generations. Suppose you witness a cow having her throat slit open and her blood flowing slowly out of the incision. She jerks around at first until numbness sets in as the last thought that crosses her mind is the grassy plains she used to feast on under an overcast sky and she's never going to see again. You'll at first feel sorry for the life lost. Then you might liken our species to the lion who jumps on its unsuspecting prey, wrestles it to the floor and savages it. Then you will shrug and think, oh well, it is what it is and this is a world where the big fish eats the smaller one. And then you're gonna go home but not before you drop by Tesco's to buy a beef fillet for lunch thinking that perhaps it would have been better to snatch half a thigh from the recently slashed animal as can trust that it won't have an horse traces in it. Unless they make cows eat horses in the animal farm you had been. So no. Deep down you couldn't give a fucking shit how cattle is killed but you just pretend to sound vaguely reasonable.</p>
<p>One could argue about the practice of religiously slaughtered meat but I don't want to get political here in this site in case I "come under fire" for speaking about a "controversial" topic and end up as news in some rag, being made to look like a fucking knobhead. This is what freedom of speech has come to.</p>
