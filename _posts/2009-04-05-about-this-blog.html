<p>I kept postponing setting up this blog mainly because I dreaded the whole process of having to clean an old WordPress account I’ve got and use its assigned e-mail address with this one. Obviously I had then had to deal with the bugs that would inevitably rise during this process, such as getting form validation errors during a new account registration telling you that the e-mail address you’re trying to use is already being used by somebody. Ideally I would like my old account removed but looking at the help documents I read that this would result in breaking some stored procedures and throwing difficult-to-trace exceptions. Well, in fact it says that “Deleting accounts could result in several issues with our software” but this is what they mean. Deleting accounts, or at least setting a “deleted” flag on some DB tables, if the SQL joins are too complex, should have been essential but, well, we don’t want anyone to get the sack over this oversight, so I just went with it and today I mustered up the energy to create a new account.</p>
<p>Knowing me, this project will most likely go the way of the others; go bonkers for a few months, maybe up to two years, then updates will space out until it becomes fossilized, hence a burden on the server of a bloke to which I’m not even giving money for the hosting. I wouldn’t want to be in his place. If, however, they decide to wipe out unused accounts a few years from now, I trust we’ll be receiving e-mails on the subject so we can do a database export or whatever. Provided I will still be giving a toss about this blog by then.</p>
