  _wp_attachment_image_alt: Planned engineering works for the weekend. Everything
    will be closed. We thought to rally the troops and fix a bit of everything. Really,
    why do you want to go out this weekend anyway? People will be fighting everywhere
    and you may get caught in the middle. Also, we know and you know there's no chance
    of you getting hooked so there's that too. Whatever, just wait until we're done.
