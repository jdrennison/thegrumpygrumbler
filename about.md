Is your carriage on your daily commute to work full of idiots? Did a driver cut you off when you had right of way? Did your broadband installer come over when you were in the shower, rang the bell once and promptly left? Does your project manager ask you for a time estimate for a task and when you tell him it will take two days he gets back to you later saying I told the client we'll do it in four hours?

With all these wrongs happening around us some of us cannot help but being grumpy. We've  got up on the wrong side of your bed. As we then get up and stretch we look back and see that actually none of the sides of the bed looks right.

Being grumpy and cynical does not necessitate being miserable and overly pessimist. You can be an otherwise cheerful, easy going person who just can’t help but spot the outrageous as soon as they walk out of their front door. It gets to you. It irritates you. Over here we'll drill down to those little things that seem to be bothering us more than anyone else. We will attempt to describe in words what the human brain picks up when it detects something against our desired order of things but we can't quite put our finger on it until we go home and reflect on the day that was.

I live and breathe in London and my star sign is Velociraptor with a Gerbil Ascendant. Also, I can be reached at thegrumpygrumbler@gmail.com. I don't check it as often as my "normal" e-mail but when I do I may not answer soon.
